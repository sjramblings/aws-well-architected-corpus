# SEC03-BP02 — Grant least privilege access

## Statement

Grant only the access that users require to perform specific actions on specific resources under specific conditions. Use group and identity attributes to dynamically set permissions at scale, rather than defining permissions for individual users. For example, you can allow a group of developers access to manage only resources for their project. This way, if a developer leaves the project, their access is automatically revoked without changing the underlying access policies.

## Desired Outcome

Users have only the minimum permissions required for their specific job functions. You use separate AWS accounts to isolate developers from production environments. When developers need to access production environments for specific tasks, they are granted limited and controlled access only for the duration of those tasks. Their production access is immediately revoked after they complete the necessary work. You conduct regular reviews of permissions and promptly revoke them when no longer needed, such as when a user changes roles or leaves the organization. You restrict administrator privileges to a small, trusted group to reduce risk exposure. You give machine or system accounts only the minimum permissions required to perform their intended tasks.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   By default, you grant users administrator permissions.
    
-   You use the root user account for daily activities.
    
-   You create overly permissive policies without proper scoping.
    
-   Your permissions reviews are infrequent, which leads to permissions creep.
    
-   You rely solely on attribute-based access control for environment isolation or permissions management.

## Implementation Guidance

The principle of [least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) states that identities should only be permitted to perform the smallest set of actions necessary to fulfill a specific task. This balances usability, efficiency, and security. Operating under this principle helps limit unintended access and helps track who has access to what resources. IAM users and roles have no permissions by default. The root user has full access by default and should be tightly controlled, monitored, and used only for [tasks that require root access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html).

IAM policies are used to explicitly grant permissions to IAM roles or specific resources. For example, identity-based policies can be attached to IAM groups, while S3 buckets can be controlled by resource-based policies.

When you create an IAM policy, you can specify the service actions, resources, and conditions that must be true for AWS to allow or deny access. AWS supports a variety of conditions to help you scope down access. For example, by using the PrincipalOrgID [condition key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html), you can deny actions if the requestor isn't a part of your AWS Organization.

You can also control requests that AWS services make on your behalf, such as AWS CloudFormation creating an AWS Lambda function, using the CalledVia condition key. You can layer different policy types to establish defense-in-depth and limit the overall permissions of your users. You can also restrict what permissions can be granted and under what conditions. For example, you can allow your workload teams to create their own IAM policies for systems they build, but only if they apply a [Permission Boundary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) to limit the maximum permissions they can grant.

### Implementation steps

-   **Implement least privilege policies**: Assign access policies with least privilege to IAM groups and roles to reflect the user's role or function that you have defined.
    
-   **Isolate development and production environments through separate AWS accounts**: Use separate AWS accounts for development and production environments, and control access between them using [service control policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html), resource policies, and identity policies.
    
-   **Base policies on API usage**: One way to determine the needed permissions is to review AWS CloudTrail logs. You can use this review to create permissions tailored to the actions that the user actually performs within AWS. [IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html) can [automatically generate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-generation.html) an IAM policy based on access activity. You can use IAM Access Advisor at the organization or account level to [track the last accessed information for a particular policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html).
    
-   **Consider using [AWS managed policies for job functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html)**: When you begin to create fine-grained permissions policies, it can be helpful to use AWS managed policies for common job roles, such as billing, database administrators, and data scientists. These policies can help narrow the access that users have while you determine how to implement the least privilege policies.
    
-   **Remove unnecessary permissions:** Detect and remove unused IAM entities, credentials, and permissions to achieve the principle of least privilege. You can use [IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-findings.html) to identify external and unused access, and [IAM Access Analyzer policy generation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-generation.html) can help fine-tune permissions policies.
    
-   **Ensure that users have limited access to production environments:** Users should only have access to production environments with a valid use case. After the user performs the specific tasks that required production access, access should be revoked. Limiting access to production environments helps prevent unintended production-impacting events and lowers the scope of impact of unintended access.
    
-   **Consider permissions boundaries:** A [permissions boundary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) is a feature for using a managed policy that sets the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. An entity's permissions boundary allows it to perform only the actions that are allowed by both its identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries.
    
-   **Refine access using attribute-based access control and resource tags** [Attribute-based access control (ABAC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html) using resource tags can be used to refine permissions when supported. You can use an ABAC model that compares principal tags to resource tags to refine access based on custom dimensions you define. This approach can simplify and reduce the number of permission policies in your organization.
    
    -   It is recommended that ABAC only be used for access control when both the principals and resources are owned by your AWS Organization. External parties may use the same tag names and values as your organization for their own principals and resources. If you rely solely on these name-value pairs for granting access to external party principals or resources, you may provide unintended permissions.
        
    
-   **Use service control policies for AWS Organizations:** [Service control policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) centrally control the maximum available permissions for member accounts in your organization. Importantly, you can use service control policies to restrict root user permissions in member accounts. Also consider using AWS Control Tower, which provides prescriptive managed controls that enrich AWS Organizations. You can also define your own controls within Control Tower.
    
-   **Establish a user lifecycle policy for your organization:** User lifecycle policies define tasks to perform when users are onboarded onto AWS, change job role or scope, or no longer need access to AWS. Perform permission reviews during each step of a user's lifecycle to verify that permissions are properly restrictive and to avoid permissions creep.
    
-   **Establish a regular schedule to review permissions and remove any unneeded permissions:** You should regularly review user access to verify that users do not have overly permissive access. [AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html) and IAM Access Analyzer can help during user permissions audits.
    
-   **Establish a job role matrix:** A job role matrix visualizes the various roles and access levels required within your AWS footprint. With a job role matrix, you can define and separate permissions based on user responsibilities within your organization. Use groups instead of applying permissions directly to individual users or roles.
