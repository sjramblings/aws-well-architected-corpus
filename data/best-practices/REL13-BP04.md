# REL13-BP04 — Manage configuration drift at the DR site or Region

## Statement

To perform a successful disaster recovery (DR) procedure, your workload must be able to resume normal operations in a timely manner with no relevant loss of functionality or data once the DR environment has been brought online. To achieve this goal, it's essential to maintain consistent infrastructure, data, and configurations between your DR environment and the primary environment.

## Desired Outcome

Your disaster recovery site's configuration and data are in parity with the primary site, which facilitates rapid and complete recovery when needed.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You fail to update recovery locations when changes are made to the primary locations, which results in outdated configurations that could hinder recovery efforts.
    
-   You do not consider potential limitations such as service differences between primary and recovery locations, which can lead to unexpected failures during failover.
    
-   You rely on manual processes to update and synchronize the DR environment, which increases the risk of human error and inconsistency.
    
-   You fail to detect configuration drift, which leads to a false sense of DR site readiness prior to an incident.

## Benefits

Consistency between the DR environment and the primary environment significantly improves the likelihood of a successful recovery after an incident and reduces the risk of a failed recovery procedure.

## Implementation Guidance

A comprehensive approach to configuration management and failover readiness can help you verify that the DR site is consistently updated and prepared to take over in the event of a primary site failure.

To achieve consistency between your primary and disaster recovery (DR) environments, validate that your delivery pipelines distribute applications to both your primary and DR sites. Roll out changes to the DR sites after an appropriate evaluation period (also known as _staggered deployments_) to detect problems at the primary site and halt the deployment before they spread. Implement monitoring to detect configuration drift, and track changes and compliance across your environments. Perform automated remediation in the DR site to keep it fully consistent and ready to take over in the event of an incident.

### Implementation steps

1.  Validate that the DR region contains the AWS services and features required for a successful execution of your DR plan.
    
2.  Use infrastructure as code (IaC). Keep your production infrastructure and application configuration templates accurate, and regularly apply them to your disaster recovery environment. [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) can detect drift between what your CloudFormation templates specify and what is actually deployed.
    
3.  Configure CI/CD pipelines to deploy applications and infrastructure updates to all environments, including primary and DR sites. CI/CD solutions such as [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) can automate the deployment process, which reduces the risk of configuration drift.
    
4.  Stagger deployments between the primary and DR environments. This approach allows updates to be initially deployed and tested in the primary environment, which isolates issues in the primary site before they are propagated to the DR site. This approach prevents defects from being simultaneously pushed to production and the DR site at the same time and maintains the integrity of the DR environment.
    
5.  Continually monitor resource configurations in both primary and DR environments. Solutions such as [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) can help to enforce configuration compliance and detect drift, which helps maintain the consistent configurations across environments.
    
6.  Implement alerting mechanisms to track and notify upon any configuration drift or data replication interruption or lag.
    
7.  Automate the remediation of detected configuration drift.
    
8.  Schedule regular audits and compliance checks to verify ongoing alignment between primary and DR configurations. Periodic reviews help you maintain compliance with defined rules and identify any discrepancies that need to be addressed.
    
9.  Check for mismatches in AWS provisioned capacity, service quotas, throttle limits, and configuration and version discrepancies.
