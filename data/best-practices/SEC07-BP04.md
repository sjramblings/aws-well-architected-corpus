# SEC07-BP04 — Define scalable data lifecycle management

## Statement

Understand your data lifecycle requirements as they relate to your different levels of data classification and handling.  This can include how data is handled when it first enters your environment, how data is transformed, and the rules for its destruction. Consider factors such as retention periods, access, auditing, and tracking provenance.

## Desired Outcome

You classify data as close as possible to the point and time of ingestion. When data classification requires masking, tokenization, or other processes that reduce sensitivity level, you perform these actions as close as possible to point and time of ingestion.

You delete data in accordance with your policy when it is no longer appropriate to keep, based on its classification.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   Implementing a one-size-fits-all approach to data lifecycle management, without considering varying sensitivity levels and access requirements.
    
-   Considering lifecycle management only from the perspective of either data that is usable, or data that is backed up, but not both.
    
-   Assuming that data that has entered your workload is valid, without establishing its value or provenance.
    
-   Relying on data durability as a substitute for data backups and protection.
    
-   Retaining data beyond its usefulness and required retention period.

## Benefits

A well-defined and scalable data lifecycle management strategy helps maintain regulatory compliance, improves data security, optimizes storage costs, and enables efficient data access and sharing while maintaining appropriate controls.

## Implementation Guidance

Data within a workload is often dynamic.  The form it takes when entering your workload environment can be different from when it is stored or used in business logic, reporting, analytics, or machine learning.  In addition, the value of data can change over time. Some data is temporal in nature and loses value as it gets older.  Consider how these changes to your data impact evaluation under your data classification scheme and associated controls.  Where possible, use an automated lifecycle mechanism, such as [Amazon S3 lifecycle policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html) and the [Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/data-lifecycle-manager/), to configure your data retention, archiving, and expiration processes. For data stored in DynamoDB, you can use the [Time To Live (TTL)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/TTL.html) feature to define a per-item expiration timestamp. 

Distinguish between data that is available for use, and data that is stored as a backup.  Consider using [AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/) to automate the backup of data across AWS services.  [Amazon EBS snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-snapshots.html) provide a way to copy an EBS volume and store it using S3 features, including lifecycle, data protection, and access to protection mechanisms. Two of these mechanisms are [S3 Object Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html) and [AWS Backup Vault Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/vault-lock.html), which can provide you with additional security and control over your backups. Manage clear separation of duties and access for backups. Isolate backups at the account level to maintain separation from the affected environment during an event.

Another aspect of lifecycle management is recording the history of data as it progresses through your workload, called _data provenance tracking_. This can give confidence that you know where the data came from, any transformations performed, what owner or process made those changes, and when.  Having this history helps with troubleshooting issues and investigations during potential security events.  For example, you can log metadata about transformations in an [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) table.  Within a data lake, you can keep copies of transformed data in different S3 buckets for each data pipeline stage. Store schema and timestamp information in an [AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/catalog-and-crawler.html).  Regardless of your solution, consider the requirements of your end users to determine the appropriate tooling you need to report on your data provenance.  This will help you determine how to best track your provenance.

### Implementation steps

1.  Analyze the workload's data types, sensitivity levels, and access requirements to classify the data and define appropriate lifecycle management strategies.
    
2.  Design and implement data retention policies and automated destruction processes that align with legal, regulatory, and organizational requirements.
    
3.  Establish processes and automation for continuous monitoring, auditing, and adjustment of data lifecycle management strategies, controls, and policies as workload requirements and regulations evolve.
    
    1.  Detect resources that do not have automated lifecycle management turned on with [AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-lifecycle-policy-check.html)
