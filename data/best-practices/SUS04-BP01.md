# SUS04-BP01 — Implement a data classification policy

## Statement

Classify data to understand its criticality to business outcomes and choose the right energy-efficient storage tier to store the data.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You do not identify data assets with similar characteristics (such as sensitivity, business criticality, or regulatory requirements) that are being processed or stored.
    
-   You have not implemented a data catalog to inventory your data assets.

## Benefits

Implementing a data classification policy allows you to determine the most energy-efficient storage tier for data.

## Implementation Guidance

Data classification involves identifying the types of data that are being processed and stored in an information system owned or operated by an organization. It also involves making a determination on the criticality of the data and the likely impact of a data compromise, loss, or misuse.

Implement data classification policy by working backwards from the contextual use of the data and creating a categorization scheme that takes into account the level of criticality of a given dataset to an organization’s operations.

### Implementation steps

-   **Perform data inventory:** Conduct an inventory of the various data types that exist for your workload.
    
-   **Group data:** Determine criticality, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data based on risk to the organization. Use these requirements to group data into one of the data classification tiers that you adopt. As an example, see [Four simple steps to classify your data and secure your startup](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/four-simple-steps-to-classify-your-data-and-secure-your-startup/).
    
-   **Define data classification levels and policies:** For each data group, define data classification level (for example, public or confidential) and handling policies. Tag data accordingly. For more detail on data classification categories, see Data Classification whitepaper.
    
-   **Periodically review:** Periodically review and audit your environment for untagged and unclassified data. Use automation to identify this data, and classify and tag the data appropriately. As an example, see [Data Catalog and crawlers in AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/catalog-and-crawler.html).
    
-   **Establish a data catalog:** Establish a data catalog that provides audit and governance capabilities.
    
-   **Documentation:** Document data classification policies and handling procedures for each data class.
