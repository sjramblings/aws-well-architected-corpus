# PERF03-BP03 — Collect and record data store performance metrics

## Statement

Track and record relevant performance metrics for your data store to understand how your data management solutions are performing. These metrics can help you optimize your data store, verify that your workload requirements are met, and provide a clear overview on how the workload performs.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You only use manual log file searching for metrics.
    
-   You only publish metrics to internal tools used by your team and don’t have a comprehensive picture of your workload.
    
-   You only use the default metrics recorded by your selected monitoring software.
    
-   You only review metrics when there is an issue.
    
-   You only monitor system-level metrics and do not capture data access or usage metrics.

## Benefits

Establishing a performance baseline helps you understand the normal behavior and requirements of workloads. Abnormal patterns can be identified and debugged faster, improving the performance and reliability of the data store.

## Implementation Guidance

To monitor the performance of your data stores, you must record multiple performance metrics over a period of time. This allows you to detect anomalies, as well as measure performance against business metrics to verify you are meeting your workload needs.

Metrics should include both the underlying system that is supporting the data store and the database metrics. The underlying system metrics might include CPU utilization, memory, available disk storage, disk I/O, cache hit ratio, and network inbound and outbound metrics, while the data store metrics might include transactions per second, top queries, average queries rates, response times, index usage, table locks, query timeouts, and number of connections open. This data is crucial to understand how the workload is performing and how the data management solution is used. Use these metrics as part of a data-driven approach to tune and optimize your workload's resources. 

Use tools, libraries, and systems that record performance measurements related to database performance.

## Implementation steps

-   Identify the key performance metrics for your data store to track.

-   Use an approved logging and monitoring solution to collect these metrics. [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) can collect metrics across the resources in your architecture. You can also collect and publish custom metrics to surface business or derived metrics. Use CloudWatch or third-party solutions to set alarms that indicate when thresholds are breached.
    
-   Check if data store monitoring can benefit from a machine learning solution that detects performance anomalies.
