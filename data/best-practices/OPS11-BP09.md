# OPS11-BP09 — Allocate time to make improvements

## Statement

Dedicate time and resources within your processes to make continuous incremental improvements possible.

## Desired Outcome

-   You create temporary duplicates of environments, which lowers the risk, effort, and cost of experimentation and testing.
    
-   These duplicated environments can be used to test the conclusions from your analysis, experiment, and develop and test planned improvements.
    
-   You run gamedays, and you use Fault Injection Service (FIS) to provide the controls and guardrails that teams need to run experiments in a production-like environment.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   There is a known performance issue in your application server. It is added to the backlog behind every planned feature implementation. If the rate of planned features being added remains constant, the performance issue would never be addressed.
    
-   To support continual improvement, you approve administrators and developers using all their extra time to select and implement improvements. No improvements are ever completed.
    
-   Operational acceptance is complete, and you do not test operational practices again.

## Benefits

By dedicating time and resources within your processes, you can make continuous, incremental improvements possible.

## Implementation Guidance

-   Allocate time to make improvements: Dedicate time and resources within your processes to make continuous, incremental improvements.
    
-   Implement changes to improve and evaluate the results to determine success.
    
-   If the results do not satisfy the goals and the improvement is still a priority, pursue alternative courses of action.
    
-   Simulate production workloads through game days, and use learnings from these simulations to improve.
