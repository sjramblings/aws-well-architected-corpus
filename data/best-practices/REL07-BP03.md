# REL07-BP03 — Obtain resources upon detection that more resources are needed for a workload

## Statement

One of the most valuable features of cloud computing is the ability to provision resources dynamically.

In traditional on-premises compute environments, you must identify and provision enough capacity in advance to serve peak demand. This is a problem because it is expensive and because it poses risks to availability if you underestimate the workload's peak capacity needs.

In the cloud, you don't have to do this. Instead, you can provision compute, database, and other resource capacity as needed to meet current and forecasted demand. Automated solutions such as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Application Auto Scaling can bring resources online for you based on metrics you specify. This can make the scaling process easier and predictable, and it can make your workload significantly more reliable by ensuring you have enough resources available at all times.

## Desired Outcome

You configure automatic scaling of compute and other resources to meet demand. You provide sufficient headroom in your scaling policies to allow bursts of traffic to be served while additional resources are brought online.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You provision a fixed number of scalable resources.
    
-   You choose a scaling metric that does not correlate to actual demand.
    
-   You fail to provide enough headroom in your scaling plans to accommodate demand bursts.
    
-   Your scaling policies add capacity too late, which leads to capacity exhaustion and degraded service while additional resources are brought online.
    
-   You fail to correctly configure minimum and maximum resource counts, which leads to scaling failures.

## Benefits

Having enough resources to meet current demand is critical to provide high availability of your workload and adhere to your defined service-level objectives (SLOs). Automatic scaling allows you to provide the right amount of compute, database, and other resources your workload needs in order to serve current and forecasted demand. You don't need to determine peak capacity needs and statically allocate resources to serve it. Instead, as demand grows, you can allocate more resources to accommodate it, and after demand falls, you can deactivate resources to reduce cost.

## Implementation Guidance

First, determine whether the workload component is suitable for automatic scaling. These components are called _horizontally scalable_ because they provide the same resources and behave identically. Examples of horizontally-scalable components include EC2 instances that are configured alike, [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) tasks, and pods running on [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/). These compute resources are typically located behind a load balancer and are referred to as _replicas_.

Other replicated resources may include database read replicas, [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) tables, and [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) (Redis OSS) clusters. For a complete list of supported resources, see [AWS services that you can use with Application Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/integrated-services-list.html).

For container-based architectures, you may need to scale two different ways. First, you may need to scale the containers that provide horizontally-scalable services. Second, you may need to scale the compute resources to make space for new containers. Different automatic scaling mechanisms exist for each layer. To scale ECS tasks, you can use [Application Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-auto-scaling.html). To scale Kubernetes pods, you can use [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) or [Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA)](https://keda.sh/). To scale the compute resources, you can use [Capacity Providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/asg-capacity-providers.html) for ECS, or for Kubernetes, you can use [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh) or [Cluster Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cluster-autoscaling/).

Next, select how you will perform automatic scaling. There are three major options: metric-based scaling, scheduled scaling, and predictive scaling.

**Metric-based scaling**

Metric-based scaling provisions resources based on the value of one or more _scaling metrics_. A scaling metric is one that corresponds to your workload's demand. A good way to determine appropriate scaling metrics is to perform load testing in a non-production environment. During your load tests, keep the number of scalable resources fixed, and slowly increase demand (for example, throughput, concurrency, or simulated users). Then look for metrics that increase (or decrease) as demand grows, and conversely decrease (or increase) as demand falls. Typical scaling metrics include CPU utilization, work queue depth (such as an [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) queue), number of active users, and network throughput.

###### Note

AWS has observed that with most applications, memory utilization increases as the application warms up and then reaches a steady value. When demand decreases, memory utilization typically remains elevated rather than decreasing in parallel. Because memory utilization does not correspond to demand in both directions–that is, growing and falling with demand–consider carefully before you select this metric for automatic scaling.

Metric-based scaling is a _latent operation_. It can take several minutes for utilization metrics to propagate to auto scaling mechanisms, and these mechanisms typically wait for a clear signal of increased demand before reacting. Then, as the auto scaler creates new resources, it can take additional time for them to come to full service. Because of this, it is important to not set your scaling metric targets too close to full utilization (for example, 90% CPU utilization). Doing so risks exhausting existing resource capacity before additional capacity can come online. Typical resource utilization targets can range between 50-70% for optimum availability, depending on demand patterns and time required to provision additional resources.

**Scheduled scaling**

Scheduled scaling provisions or removes resources based on the calendar or time of day. It is frequently used for workloads that have predictable demand, such as peak utilization during weekday business hours or sales events. Both [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scheduled-scaling.html) and [Application Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-scheduled-scaling.html) support scheduled scaling. KEDA's [cron scaler](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/cron/) supports scheduled scaling of Kubernetes pods.

**Predictive scaling**

Predictive scaling uses machine learning to automatically scale resources based on anticipated demand. Predictive scaling analyzes the historical value of a utilization metric you provide and continuously predicts its future value. The predicted value is then used to scale the resource up or down. [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-predictive-scaling.html) can perform predictive scaling.

### Implementation steps

1.  Determine whether the workload component is suitable for automatic scaling.
    
2.  Determine what kind of scaling mechanism is most appropriate for the workload: metric-based scaling, scheduled scaling, or predictive scaling.
    
3.  Select the appropriate automatic scaling mechanism for the component. For Amazon EC2 instances, use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. For other AWS services, use Application Auto Scaling. For Kubernetes pods (such as those running in an Amazon EKS cluster), consider Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) or Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA). For Kubernetes or EKS nodes, consider Karpenter and Cluster Auto Scaler (CAS).
    
4.  For metric or scheduled scaling, conduct load testing to determine the appropriate scaling metrics and target values for your workload. For scheduled scaling, determine the number of resources needed at the dates and times you select. Determine the maximum number of resources needed to serve expected peak traffic.
    
5.  Configure the auto scaler based on the information collected above. Consult the auto scaling service's documentation for details. Verify that the maximum and minimum scaling limits are configured correctly.
    
6.  Verify the scaling configuration is working as expected. Perform load testing in a non-production environment and observe how the system reacts, and adjust as needed. When enabling auto scaling in production, configure appropriate alarms to notify you of any unexpected behavior.
