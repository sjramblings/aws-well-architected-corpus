# SUS05-BP04 — Optimize your use of hardware-based compute accelerators

## Statement

Optimize your use of accelerated computing instances to reduce the physical infrastructure demands of your workload.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You are not monitoring GPU usage.
    
-   You are using a general-purpose instance for workload while a purpose-built instance can deliver higher performance, lower cost, and better performance per watt.
    
-   You are using hardware-based compute accelerators for tasks where they’re more efficient using CPU-based alternatives.

## Benefits

By optimizing the use of hardware-based accelerators, you can reduce the physical-infrastructure demands of your workload.

## Implementation Guidance

If you require high processing capability, you can benefit from using accelerated computing instances, which provide access to hardware-based compute accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). These hardware accelerators perform certain functions like graphic processing or data pattern matching more efficiently than CPU-based alternatives. Many accelerated workloads, such as rendering, transcoding, and machine learning, are highly variable in terms of resource usage. Only run this hardware for the time needed, and decommission them with automation when not required to minimize resources consumed.

## Implementation steps

-   **Explore compute accelerators:** Identify which [accelerated computing instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/accelerated-computing-instances.html) can address your requirements.
    
-   **Use purpose-built hardware:** For machine learning workloads, take advantage of purpose-built hardware that is specific to your workload, such as [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/), [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/), and [Amazon EC2 DL1](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/dl1/). AWS Inferentia instances such as Inf2 instances offer up to [50% better performance per watt over comparable Amazon EC2 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/).
    
-   **Monitor usage metrics:** Collect usage metric for your accelerated computing instances. For example, you can use CloudWatch agent to collect metrics such as `utilization_gpu` and `utilization_memory` for your GPUs as shown in [Collect NVIDIA GPU metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-NVIDIA-GPU.html).
    
-   **Rightsize:** Optimize the code, network operation, and settings of hardware accelerators to make sure that underlying hardware is fully utilized.

-   **Keep up to date:** Use the latest high performant libraries and GPU drivers.
    
-   **Release unneeded instances:** Use automation to release GPU instances when not in use.
