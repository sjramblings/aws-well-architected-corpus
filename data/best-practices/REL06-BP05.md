# REL06-BP05 — Analyze logs

## Statement

Collect log files and metrics histories and analyze these for broader trends and workload insights.

Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights supports a [simple yet powerful query language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax.html) that you can use to analyze log data. Amazon CloudWatch Logs also supports subscriptions that allow data to flow seamlessly to Amazon S3 where you can use or Amazon Athena to query the data. It also supports queries on a large array of formats. See [Supported SerDes and Data Formats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/supported-format.html) in the Amazon Athena User Guide for more information. For analysis of huge log file sets, you can run an Amazon EMR cluster to run petabyte-scale analyses.

There are a number of tools provided by AWS Partners and third parties that allow for aggregation, processing, storage, and analytics. These tools include New Relic, Splunk, Loggly, Logstash, CloudHealth, and Nagios. However, outside generation of system and application logs is unique to each cloud provider, and often unique to each service.

An often-overlooked part of the monitoring process is data management. You need to determine the retention requirements for monitoring data, and then apply lifecycle policies accordingly. Amazon S3 supports lifecycle management at the S3 bucket level. This lifecycle management can be applied differently to different paths in the bucket. Toward the end of the lifecycle, you can transition data to Amazon Glacier for long-term storage, and then expiration after the end of the retention period is reached. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.

## Implementation Guidance

-   CloudWatch Logs Insights allows you to interactively search and analyze your log data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

-   Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to send logs to Amazon S3 where you can use or Amazon Athena to query the data.

        -   Create an S3 lifecycle policy for your server access logs bucket. Configure the lifecycle policy to periodically remove log files. Doing so reduces the amount of data that Athena analyzes for each query.
