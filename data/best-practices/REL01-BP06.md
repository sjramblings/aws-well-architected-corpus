# REL01-BP06 — Ensure that a sufficient gap exists between the current quotas and the maximum usage to accommodate failover

## Statement

This article explains how to maintain space between the resource quota and your usage, and how it can benefit your organization. After you finish using a resource, the usage quota may continue to account for that resource. This can result in a failing or inaccessible resource. Prevent resource failure by verifying that your quotas cover the overlap of inaccessible resources and their replacements. Consider cases like network failure, Availability Zone failure, or Region failures when calculating this gap.

## Desired Outcome

Small or large failures in resources or resource accessibility can be covered within the current service thresholds. Zone failures, network failures, or even Regional failures have been considered in the resource planning.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   Setting service quotas based on current needs without accounting for failover scenarios.
    
-   Not considering the principals of static stability when calculating the peak quota for a service.
    
-   Not considering the potential of inaccessible resources in calculating total quota needed for each Region.
    
-   Not considering AWS service fault isolation boundaries for some services and their potential abnormal usage patterns.

## Benefits

When service disruption events impact application availability, use the cloud to implement strategies to recover from these events. An example strategy is creating additional resources to replace inaccessible resources to accommodate failover conditions without exhausting your service limit.

## Implementation Guidance

When evaluating a quota limit, consider failover cases that might occur due to some degradation. Consider the following failover cases.

-   A disrupted or inaccessible VPC.
    
-   An inaccessible subnet.
    
-   A degraded Availability Zone that impacts resource accessibility.
    
-   Networking routes or ingress and egress points are blocked or changed.
    
-   A degraded Region that impacts resource accessibility.
    
-   A subset of resources affected by a failure in a Region or an Availability Zone.
    

The decision to failover is unique for each situation, as the business impact can vary. Address resource capacity planning in the failover location and the resources’ quotas before deciding to failover an application or service.

Consider higher than normal peaks of activity when reviewing quotas for each service. These peaks might be related to resources that are inaccessible due to networking or permissions, but are still active. Unterminated active resources count against the service quota limit.

**Implementation steps**

-   Maintain space between your service quota and your maximum usage to accommodate for a failover or loss of accessibility.
    
-   Determine your service quotas. Account for typical deployment patterns, availability requirements, and consumption growth.
    
-   Request quota increases if necessary. Anticipate a wait time for the quota increase request.
    
-   Determine your reliability requirements (also known as your number of nines).
    
-   Understand potential fault scenarios such as loss of a component, an Availability Zone, or a Region.
    
-   Establish your deployment methodology (examples include canary, blue/green, red/black, and rolling).
    
-   Include an appropriate buffer to the current quota limit. An example buffer could be 15%.
    
-   Include calculations for static stability (Zonal and Regional) where appropriate.
    
-   Plan consumption growth and monitor your consumption trends.
    
-   Consider the static stability impact for your most critical workloads. Assess resources conforming to a statically stable system in all Regions and Availability Zones.
    
-   Consider using On-Demand Capacity Reservations to schedule capacity ahead of any failover. This is a useful strategy to implement for critical business schedules to reduce potential risks of obtaining the correct quantity and type of resources during failover.
