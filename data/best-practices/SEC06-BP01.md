# SEC06-BP01 — Perform vulnerability management

## Statement

Frequently scan and patch for vulnerabilities in your code, dependencies, and in your infrastructure to help protect against new threats.

## Desired Outcome

You have a solution that continually scans your workload for software vulnerabilities, potential defects, and unintended network exposure. You have established processes and procedures to identify, prioritize, and remediate these vulnerabilities based on risk assessment criteria. Additionally, you have implemented automated patch management for your compute instances. Your vulnerability management program is integrated into your software development lifecycle, with solutions to scan your source code during the CI/CD pipeline.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   Not having a vulnerability management program.
    
-   Performing system patching without considering severity or risk avoidance.
    
-   Using software that has passed its vendor-provided end of life (EOL) date.
    
-   Deploying code into production before analyzing it for security issues.

## Implementation Guidance

Vulnerability management is a key aspect of maintaining a secure and robust cloud environment. It involves a comprehensive process that includes security scans, identification and prioritization of issues, and patch operations to resolve the identified vulnerabilities. Automation plays a pivotal role in this process because it facilitates continuous scanning of workloads for potential issues and unintended network exposure, as well as remediation efforts.

The [AWS Shared Responsibility Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/shared-responsibility.html) is a fundamental concept that underpins vulnerability management. According to this model, AWS is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure, including hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS services. Conversely, you are responsible for securing your data, security configurations, and management tasks associated with services like Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon S3 objects.

AWS offers a range of services to support vulnerability management programs. [Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/) continuously scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network access, while [AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager.html) helps manage patching across Amazon EC2 instances. These services can be integrated with [AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/), a cloud security posture management service that automates AWS security checks, centralizes security alerts, and provides a comprehensive view of an organization's security posture. Furthermore, [Amazon CodeGuru Security](https://aws.amazon.com/codeguru/) uses static code analysis to identify potential issues in Java and Python applications during the development phase.

By incorporating vulnerability management practices into the software development lifecycle, you can proactively address vulnerabilities before they are introduced into production environments, which reduces the risk of security events and minimizes the potential impact of vulnerabilities.

### Implementation steps

1.  **Understand the shared responsibility model:** Review the AWS shared responsibility model to understand your responsibilities for securing your workloads and data in the cloud. AWS is responsible for securing the underlying cloud infrastructure, while you are responsible for securing your applications, data, and the services you use.
    
2.  **Implement vulnerability scanning**: Configure a vulnerability scanning service, such as Amazon Inspector, to automatically scan your compute instances (for example, virtual machines, containers, or serverless functions) for software vulnerabilities, potential defects, and unintended network exposure.
    
3.  **Establish vulnerability management processes:** Define processes and procedures to identify, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities. This may include the setup of regular vulnerability scanning schedules, establishment of risk assessment criteria, and definition of remediation timelines based on vulnerability severity.
    
4.  **Set up patch management:** Use a patch management service to automate the process of patching your compute instances, both for operating systems and applications. You can configure the service to scan instances for missing patches and automatically install them on a schedule. Consider AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to provide this functionality.
    
5.  **Configure malware protection:** Implement mechanisms to detect malicious software in your environment. For example, you can use tools like [Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/) to analyze, detect, and alert of malware in EC2 and EBS volumes. GuardDuty can also scan newly uploaded objects to Amazon S3 for potential malware or viruses and take action to isolate them before they are ingested into downstream processes.
    
6.  **Integrate vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipelines:** If you're using a CI/CD pipeline for your application deployment, integrate vulnerability scanning tools into your pipeline. Tools like Amazon CodeGuru Security and open-source options can scan your source code, dependencies, and artifacts for potential security issues.
    
7.  **Configure a security monitoring service:** Set up a security monitoring service, such as AWS Security Hub CSPM, to get a comprehensive view of your security posture across multiple cloud services. The service should collect security findings from various sources and present them in a standardized format for easier prioritization and remediation.
    
8.  **Implement web application penetration testing**: If your application is a web application, and your organization has the necessary skills or can hire outside assistance, consider implementing web application penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in your application.
    
9.  **Automate with infrastructure as code**: Use infrastructure as code (IaC) tools, such as [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), to automate the deployment and configuration of your resources, including the security services mentioned previously. This practice helps you create a more consistent and standardized resource architecture across multiple accounts and environments.
    
10.  **Monitor and continually improve**: Continually monitor your vulnerability management program's effectiveness, and make improvements as needed. Review security findings, assess the effectiveness of your remediation efforts, and adjust your processes and tools accordingly.
