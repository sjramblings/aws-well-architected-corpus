# REL04-BP03 — Do constant work

## Statement

Systems can fail when there are large, rapid changes in load. For example, if your workload is doing a health check that monitors the health of thousands of servers, it should send the same size payload (a full snapshot of the current state) each time. Whether no servers are failing, or all of them, the health check system is doing constant work with no large, rapid changes.

For example, if the health check system is monitoring 100,000 servers, the load on it is nominal under the normally light server failure rate. However, if a major event makes half of those servers unhealthy, then the health check system would be overwhelmed trying to update notification systems and communicate state to its clients. So instead the health check system should send the full snapshot of the current state each time. 100,000 server health states, each represented by a bit, would only be a 12.5-KB payload. Whether no servers are failing, or all of them are, the health check system is doing constant work, and large, rapid changes are not a threat to the system stability. This is actually how Amazon Route 53 handles health checks for endpoints (such as IP addresses) to determine how end users are routed to them.

## Implementation Guidance

-   Do constant work so that systems do not fail when there are large, rapid changes in load.
    
-   Implement loosely coupled dependencies. Dependencies such as queuing systems, streaming systems, workflows, and load balancers are loosely coupled. Loose coupling helps isolate behavior of a component from other components that depend on it, increasing resiliency and agility.

        -   For the example of a health check system monitoring 100,000 servers, engineer workloads so that payload sizes remain constant regardless of number of successes or failures.
