# SEC11-BP05 — Centralize services for packages and dependencies

## Statement

Provide centralized services for your teams to obtain software packages and other dependencies. This allows the validation of packages before they are included in the software that you write and provides a source of data for the analysis of the software being used in your organization.

## Desired Outcome

You build your workload from external software packages in addition to the code that you write. This makes it simpler for you to implement functionality that is repeatedly used, such as a JSON parser or an encryption library. You centralize the sources for these packages and dependencies so your security team can validate them before they are used. You use this approach in conjunction with the manual and automated testing flows to increase the confidence in the quality of the software that you develop.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You pull packages from arbitrary repositories on the internet.
    
-   You don't test new packages before you make them available to builders.

## Benefits

-   Better understanding of what packages are being used in the software being built.
    
-   Being able to notify workload teams when a package needs to be updated based on the understanding of who is using what.
    
-   Reducing the risk of a package with issues being included in your software.

## Implementation Guidance

Provide centralized services for packages and dependencies in a way that is simple for builders to consume. Centralized services can be logically central rather than implemented as a monolithic system. This approach allows you to provide services in a way that meets the needs of your builders. You should implement an efficient way of adding packages to the repository when updates happen or new requirements emerge. AWS services such as [AWS CodeArtifact](https://aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/) or similar AWS partner solutions provide a way of delivering this capability.

### Implementation steps

-   Implement a logically centralized repository service that is available in all of the environments where software is developed.
    
-   Include access to the repository as part of the AWS account vending process.
    
-   Build automation to test packages before they are published in a repository.
    
-   Maintain metrics of the most commonly used packages, languages, and teams with the highest amount of change.
    
-   Provide an automated mechanism for builder teams to request new packages and provide feedback.
    
-   Regularly scan packages in your repository to identify the potential impact of newly discovered issues.
