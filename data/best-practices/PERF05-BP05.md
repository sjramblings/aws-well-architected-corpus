# PERF05-BP05 — Use automation to proactively remediate performance-related issues

## Statement

Use key performance indicators (KPIs), combined with monitoring and alerting systems, to proactively address performance-related issues.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You only allow operations staff the ability to make operational changes to the workload.
    
-   You let all alarms filter to the operations team with no proactive remediation.

## Benefits

Proactive remediation of alarm actions allows support staff to concentrate on those items that are not automatically actionable. This helps operations staff handle all alarms without being overwhelmed and instead focus only on critical alarms.

## Implementation Guidance

Use alarms to trigger automated actions to remediate issues where possible. Escalate the alarm to those able to respond if automated response is not possible. For example, you may have a system that can predict expected key performance indicator (KPI) values and alarm when they breach certain thresholds, or a tool that can automatically halt or roll back deployments if KPIs are outside of expected values.

Implement processes that provide visibility into performance as your workload is running. Build monitoring dashboards and establish baseline norms for performance expectations to determine if the workload is performing optimally.

### Implementation steps

-   **Identify remediation workflow:** Identify and understand the performance issue that can be remediated automatically. Use AWS monitoring solutions such as [Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) or AWS X-Ray to help you better understand the root cause of the issue.
    
-   **Define the automation process:** Create a step-by-step remediation process that can be used to automatically fix the issue.
    
-   **Configure the initiation event:** Configure the event to automatically initiate the remediation process. For example, you can define a trigger to automatically restart an instance when it reaches a certain threshold of CPU utilization.
    
-   **Automate the remediation:** Use AWS services and technologies to automate the remediation process. For example, [AWS Systems Manager Automation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html) provides a secure and scalable way to automate the remediation process. Make sure to use self-healing logic to revert changes if they do not successfully resolve the issue.
    
-   **Test the workflow** Test the automated remediation process in a pre-production environment.
    
-   **Implement the workflow:** Implement the automated remediation in the production environment.
    
-   **Develop a playbook:** Develop and document a playbook that outlines the steps for the remediation plan, including the initiation events, remediation logic, and actions taken. Make sure to train stakeholders to help them effectively respond to automated remediation events.
    
-   **Review and refine:** Regularly assess the effectiveness of the automated remediation workflow. Adjust initiation events and remediation logic if necessary.
