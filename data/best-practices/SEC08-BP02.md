# SEC08-BP02 — Enforce encryption at rest

## Statement

Encrypt private data at rest to maintain confidentiality and provide an additional layer of protection against unintended data disclosure or exfiltration. Encryption protects data so that it cannot be read or accessed without first being decrypted. Inventory and control unencrypted data to mitigate risks associated with data exposure.

## Desired Outcome

You have mechanisms that encrypt private data by default when at rest. These mechanisms help maintain the confidentiality of the data and provides an additional layer of protection against unintended data disclosure or exfiltration. You maintain an inventory of unencrypted data and understand the controls that are in place to protect it.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   Not using encrypt-by-default configurations.
    
-   Providing overly permissive access to decryption keys.
    
-   Not monitoring the use of encryption and decryption keys.
    
-   Storing data unencrypted.
    
-   Using the same encryption key for all data regardless of data usage, types, and classification.

## Implementation Guidance

Map encryption keys to data classifications within your workloads. This approach helps protect against overly permissive access when using either a single, or very small number of encryption keys for your data (see [SEC07-BP01 Understand your data classification scheme](./sec_data_classification_identify_data.html)).

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) integrates with many AWS services to make it easier to encrypt your data at rest. For example, in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), you can set [default encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/work-with-ebs-encr.html#encryption-by-default) on accounts so that new EBS volumes are automatically encrypted. When using AWS KMS, consider how tightly the data needs to be restricted. Default and service-controlled AWS KMS keys are managed and used on your behalf by AWS. For sensitive data that requires fine-grained access to the underlying encryption key, consider customer managed keys (CMKs). You have full control over CMKs, including rotation and access management through the use of key policies.

Additionally, services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service ([Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-encrypts-new-objects-by-default/)) now encrypt all new objects by default. This implementation provides enhanced security with no impact on performance.

Other services, such as [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-by-default) (Amazon EC2) or [Amazon Elastic File System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/encryption-best-practices/efs.html) (Amazon EFS), support settings for default encryption. You can also use [AWS Config Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html) to automatically check that you are using encryption for [Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/encrypted-volumes.html), [Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/rds-storage-encrypted.html), [Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-default-encryption-kms.html), and other services within your organization.

AWS also provides options for client-side encryption, allowing you to encrypt data prior to uploading it to the cloud. The AWS Encryption SDK provides a way to encrypt your data using [envelope encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping). You provide the wrapping key, and the AWS Encryption SDK generates a unique data key for each data object it encrypts. Consider AWS CloudHSM if you need a managed single-tenant hardware security module (HSM). AWS CloudHSM allows you to generate, import, and manage cryptographic keys on a FIPS 140-2 level 3 validated HSM. Some use cases for AWS CloudHSM include protecting private keys for issuing a certificate authority (CA), and turning on transparent data encryption (TDE) for Oracle databases. The AWS CloudHSM Client SDK provides software that allows you to encrypt data client side using keys stored inside AWS CloudHSM prior to uploading your data into AWS. The Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client also allows you to encrypt and sign items prior to upload into a DynamoDB table.

### Implementation steps

-   **Configure** [**default encryption for new Amazon EBS volumes**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html)**:** Specify that you want all newly created Amazon EBS volumes to be created in encrypted form, with the option of using the default key provided by AWS or a key that you create.
    
-   **Configure encrypted Amazon Machine Images (AMIs):** Copying an existing AMI with encryption configured will automatically encrypt root volumes and snapshots.
    
-   **Configure** [**Amazon RDS encryption**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html)**:** Configure encryption for your Amazon RDS database clusters and snapshots at rest by using the encryption option.
    
-   **Create and configure AWS KMS keys with policies that limit access to the appropriate principals for each classification of data:** For example, create one AWS KMS key for encrypting production data and a different key for encrypting development or test data. You can also provide key access to other AWS accounts. Consider having different accounts for your development and production environments. If your production environment needs to decrypt artifacts in the development account, you can edit the CMK policy used to encrypt the development artifacts to give the production account the ability to decrypt those artifacts. The production environment can then ingest the decrypted data for use in production.
    
-   **Configure encryption in additional AWS services:** For other AWS services you use, review the [security documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security/) for that service to determine the service's encryption options.
