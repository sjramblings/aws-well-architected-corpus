# REL05-BP06 — Make systems stateless where possible

## Statement

Systems should either not require state, or should offload state such that between different client requests, there is no dependence on locally stored data on disk and in memory. This allows servers to be replaced at will without causing an availability impact.

When users or services interact with an application, they often perform a series of interactions that form a session. A session is unique data for users that persists between requests while they use the application. A stateless application is an application that does not need knowledge of previous interactions and does not store session information.

Once designed to be stateless, you can then use serverless compute services, such as AWS Lambda or AWS Fargate.

In addition to server replacement, another benefit of stateless applications is that they can scale horizontally because any of the available compute resources (such as EC2 instances and AWS Lambda functions) can service any request.

## Benefits

Systems that are designed to be stateless are more adaptable to horizontal scaling, making it possible to add or remove capacity based on fluctuating traffic and demand. They are also inherently resilient to failures and provide flexibility and agility in application development.

## Implementation Guidance

Make your applications stateless. Stateless applications allow horizontal scaling and are tolerant to the failure of an individual node. Analyze and understand the components of your application that maintain state within the architecture. This helps you assess the potential impact of transitioning to a stateless design. A stateless architecture decouples user data and offloads the session data. This provides the flexibility to scale each component independently to meet varying workload demands and optimize resource utilization.

### Implementation steps

-   Identify and understand the stateful components in your application.
    
-   Decouple data by separating and managing user data from the core application logic.
    
    -   [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) can decouple user data from application code by using features, such as [identity pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/getting-started-with-identity-pools.html), [user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/getting-started-with-cognito-user-pools.html), and [Amazon Cognito Sync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-sync.html).
        
    -   You can use [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) decouple user data by storing secrets in a secure, centralized location. This means that the application code doesn't need to store secrets, which makes it more secure.
        
    -   Consider using [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store large, unstructured data, such as images and documents. Your application can retrieve this data when required, eliminating the need to store it in memory.
        
    -   Use [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) to store information such as user profiles. Your application can query this data in near-real time.
        
    
-   Offload session data to a database, cache, or external files.
    
    -   [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/), Amazon DynamoDB, [Amazon Elastic File System](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) (Amazon EFS), and [Amazon MemoryDB](https://aws.amazon.com/memorydb/) are examples of AWS services that you can use to offload session data.
        
    
-   Design a stateless architecture after you identify which state and user data need to be persisted with your storage solution of choice.
