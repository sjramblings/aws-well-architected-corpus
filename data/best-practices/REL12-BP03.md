# REL12-BP03 — Test scalability and performance requirements

## Statement

Use techniques such as load testing to validate that the workload meets scaling and performance requirements.

In the cloud, you can create a production-scale test environment for your workload on demand. Instead of reliance on a scaled-down test environment, which could lead to inaccurate predictions of production behaviors, you can use the cloud to provision a test environment that closely mirrors your expected production environment. This environment helps you test in a more accurate simulation of the real-world conditions your application faces.

Alongside your performance testing efforts, it's essential to validate that your base resources, scaling settings, service quotas, and resiliency design operate as expected under load. This holistic approach verifies that your application can reliably scale and perform as required, even under the most demanding conditions.

## Desired Outcome

Your workload maintains its expected behavior even while subject to peak load. You proactively address any performance-related issues that may arise as the application grows and evolves.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You use test environments that do not closely match the production environment.
    
-   You treat load testing as a separate, one-time activity rather than an integrated part of the deployment continuous integration (CI) pipeline.
    
-   You don't define clear and measurable performance requirements, such as response time, throughput, and scalability targets.
    
-   You perform tests with unrealistic or insufficient load scenarios, and you fail to test for peak loads, sudden spikes, and sustained high load.
    
-   You don't stress test the workload by exceeding expected load limits.
    
-   You use inadequate or inappropriate load testing and performance profiling tools.
    
-   You lack comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems to track performance metrics and detect anomalies.

## Benefits

-   Load testing helps you identify potential performance bottlenecks in your system before it goes into production. When you simulate production-level traffic and workloads, you can identify areas where your system may struggle to handle the load, such as slow response times, resource constraints, or system failures.
    
-   As you test your system under various load conditions, you can better understand the resource requirements needed to support your workload. This information can help you make informed decisions about resource allocation and prevent over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources.
    
-   To identify potential failure points, you can observe how your workload performs under high load conditions. This information helps you improve your workload's reliability and resiliency by implementing fault-tolerance mechanisms, failover strategies, and redundancy measures, as appropriate.
    
-   You identify and address performance issues early, which helps you avoid the costly consequences of system outages, slow response times, and dissatisfied users.
    
-   Detailed performance data and profiling information collected during testing can help you troubleshoot performance-related issues that may arise in production. This can lead to faster incident response and resolution, which reduces the impact on users and your organization's operations.
    
-   In certain industries, proactive performance testing can help your workload meet compliance standards, which reduces the risk of penalties or legal issues.

## Implementation Guidance

The first step is to define a comprehensive testing strategy that covers all aspects of scaling and performance requirements. To start, clearly define your workload's service-level objectives (SLOs) based on your business needs, such as throughput, latency histogram, and error rate. Next, design a suite of tests that can simulate various load scenarios that range from average usage to sudden spikes and sustained peak loads, and verify that the workload's behavior meets your SLOs. These tests should be automated and integrated into your continuous integration and deployment pipeline to catch performance regressions early in the development process.

To effectively test scaling and performance, invest in the right tools and infrastructure. This includes load testing tools that can generate realistic user traffic, performance profiling tools to identify bottlenecks, and monitoring solutions to track key metrics. Importantly, you should verify that your test environments closely match the production environment in terms of infrastructure and environment conditions to make your test results as accurate as possible. To make it easier to reliably replicate and scale production-like setups, use infrastructure as code and container-based applications.

Scaling and performance tests are an ongoing process, not a one-time activity. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting to track the application's performance in production, and use this data to continually refine your test strategies and optimization efforts. Regularly analyze performance data to identify emerging issues, test new scaling strategies, and implement optimizations to improve the application's efficiency and reliability. When you adopt an iterative approach and constantly learn from production data, you can verify that your application can adapt to variable user demands and maintain resiliency and optimal performance over time.

### Implementation steps

1.  Establish clear and measurable performance requirements, such as response time, throughput, and scalability targets. These requirements should be based on your workload's usage patterns, user expectations, and business needs.
    
2.  Select and configure a load testing tool that can accurately mimic the load patterns and user behavior in your production environment.
    
3.  Set up a test environment that closely matches the production environment, including infrastructure and environment conditions, to improve the accuracy of your test results.
    
4.  Create a test suite that covers a wide range of scenarios, from average usage patterns to peak loads, rapid spikes, and sustained high loads. Integrate the tests into your continuous integration and deployment pipelines to catch performance regressions early in the development process.
    
5.  Conduct load testing to simulate real-world user traffic and understand how your application behaves under different load conditions. To stress test your application, exceed the expected load and observe its behavior, such as response time degradation, resource exhaustion, or system failures, which helps identify the breaking point of your application and inform scaling strategies. Evaluate the scalability of your workload by incrementally increasing the load, and measure the performance impact to identify scaling limits and plan for future capacity needs.
    
6.  Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting to track performance metrics, detect anomalies, and initiate scaling actions or notifications when thresholds are exceeded.
    
7.  Continually monitor and analyze performance data to identify areas for improvement. Iterate on your testing strategies and optimization efforts.
