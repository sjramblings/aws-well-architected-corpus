# OPS11-BP07 — Perform operations metrics reviews

## Statement

Regularly perform retrospective analysis of operations metrics with cross-team participants from different areas of the business. Use these reviews to identify opportunities for improvement, potential courses of action, and to share lessons learned. Look for opportunities to improve in all of your environments (for example, development, test, and production).

## Desired Outcome

-   You frequently review business-affecting metrics
    
-   You detect and review anomalies through your observability capabilities
    
-   You use data to support business outcomes and goals

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   Your maintenance window interrupts a significant retail promotion. The business remains unaware that there is a standard maintenance window that could be delayed if there are other business impacting events.
    
-   You suffered an extended outage because you commonly use an outdated library in your organization. You have since migrated to a supported library. The other teams in your organization do not know that they are at risk.
    
-   You do not regularly review attainment of customer SLAs. You are trending to not meet your customer SLAs. There are financial penalties related to not meeting your customer SLAs.

## Benefits

-   When you meet regularly to review operations metrics, events, and incidents, you maintain common understanding across teams.
    
-   Your team meets routinely to review metrics and incidents, which positions you to take action on risks and recognize customer SLAs.
    
-   You share lessons learned, which provides data for prioritization and targeted improvements for business outcomes.

## Implementation Guidance

-   Regularly perform retrospective analysis of operations metrics with cross-team participants from different areas of the business.
    
-   Engage stakeholders, including the business, development, and operations teams, to validate your findings from immediate feedback and retrospective analysis and share lessons learned.
    
-   Use their insights to identify opportunities for improvement and potential courses of action.
