# SEC04-BP04 — Initiate remediation for non-compliant resources

## Statement

Your detective controls may alert on resources that are out of compliance with your configuration requirements. You can initiate programmatically-defined remediations, either manually or automatically, to fix these resources and help minimize potential impacts. When you define remediations programmatically, you can take prompt and consistent action.

While automation can enhance security operations, you should implement and manage automation carefully.  Place appropriate oversight and control mechanisms to verify that automated responses are effective, accurate, and aligned with organizational policies and risk appetite.

## Desired Outcome

You define resource configuration standards along with the steps to remediate when resources are detected to be non-compliant. Where possible, you've defined remediations programmatically so they can be initiated either manually or through automation. Detection systems are in place to identify non-compliant resources and publish alerts into centralized tools that are monitored by your security personnel. These tools support running your programmatic remediations, either manually or automatically. Automatic remediations have appropriate oversight and control mechanisms in place to govern their use.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You implement automation, but fail to thoroughly test and validate remediation actions. This can result in unintended consequences, such as disrupting legitimate business operations or causing system instability.
    
-   You improve response times and procedures through automation, but without proper monitoring and mechanisms that allow human intervention and judgment when needed.
    
-   You rely solely on remediations, rather than having remediations as one part of a broader incident response and recovery program.

## Benefits

Automatic remediations can respond to misconfigurations faster than manual processes, which helps you minimize potential business impacts and reduce the window of opportunity for unintended uses. When you define remediations programmatically, they are applied consistently, which reduces the risk of human error. Automation also can handle a larger volume of alerts simultaneously, which is particularly important in environments operating at large scale.

## Implementation Guidance

As described in [SEC01-BP03 Identify and validate control objectives](./sec_securely_operate_control_objectives.html), services such as [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) and [AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/) can help you monitor the configuration of resources in your accounts for adherence to your requirements. When non-compliant resources are detected, services such as AWS Security Hub CSPM, can help with routing alerts appropriately and remediation. These solutions provide a central place for your security investigators to monitor for issues and take corrective action.

In addition to AWS Security Hub CSPM, AWS introduced [Security Hub Advanced](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/). This service, announced at re:Invent 2025, transforms how organizations prioritize their most critical security issues and respond at scale to protect their cloud environments. The enhanced Security Hub now uses advanced analytics to automatically correlate, enrich, and prioritize security signals across your cloud environment. Security Hub seamlessly integrates with [Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/), [Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/), [Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/), and [AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/cspm/features/). Correlated findings in Security Hub can result in a net-new finding, called an exposure finding, which includes an assumed attack path based on vulnerabilities found in each resource.

While some non-compliant resource situations are unique and require human judgment to remediate, other situations have a standard response that you can define programmatically. For example, a standard response to a misconfigured VPC security group could be to remove the disallowed rules and notify the owner. Responses can be defined in [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda) functions, [AWS Systems Manager Automation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html) documents, or through other code environments you prefer. Make sure the environment is able to authenticate to AWS using an IAM role with the least amount of permission needed to take corrective action.

Once you define the desired remediation, you can then determine your preferred means for initiating it. AWS Config can [initiate remediations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/remediation.html) for you. If you are using Security Hub CSPM, you can do this through [custom actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-cwe-custom-actions.html), which publishes the finding information to [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/). An EventBridge rule can then initiate your remediation. You can configure remediations through Security Hub CSPM to run either automatically or manually. 

For programmatic remediation, we recommend that you have comprehensive logs and audits for the actions taken, as well as their outcomes. Review and analyze these logs to assess the effectiveness of the automated processes, and identify areas of improvement. Capture logs in [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) and remediation outcomes as [finding notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-findings.html) in Security Hub CSPM.

As a starting point, consider [Automated Security Response on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/automated-security-response-on-aws/), which has pre-built remediations for resolving common security misconfigurations.

### Implementation steps

1.  Analyze and prioritize alerts.
    
    1.  Consolidate security alerts from various AWS services into Security Hub CSPM for centralized visibility, prioritization, and remediation.
        
    
2.  Develop remediations.
    
    1.  Use services such as Systems Manager and AWS Lambda to run programmatic remediations.
        
    
3.  Configure how remediations are initiated.
    
    1.  Using Systems Manager, define custom actions that publish findings to EventBridge. Configure these actions to be initiated manually or automatically.
        
    2.  You can also use [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) to send notifications and alerts to relevant stakeholders (like security team or incident response teams) for manual intervention or escalation, if required.
        
    
4.  Review and analyze remediation logs for effectiveness and improvement.
    
    1.  Send log output to CloudWatch Logs. Capture outcomes as finding notes in Security Hub CSPM.
