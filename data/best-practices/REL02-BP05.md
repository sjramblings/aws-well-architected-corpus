# REL02-BP05 — Enforce non-overlapping private IP address ranges in all private address spaces where they are connected

## Statement

The IP address ranges of each of your VPCs must not overlap when peered, connected via Transit Gateway, or connected over VPN. Avoid IP address conflicts between a VPC and on-premises environments or with other cloud providers that you use. You must also have a way to allocate private IP address ranges when needed. An IP address management (IPAM) system can help with automating this.

## Desired Outcome

-   No IP address range conflicts between VPCs, on-premises environments, or other cloud providers.
    
-   Proper IP address management allows for easier scaling of network infrastructure to accommodate growth and changes in network requirements.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   Using the same IP range in your VPC as you have on premises, in your corporate network, or other cloud providers
    
-   Not tracking IP ranges of VPCs used to deploy your workloads.
    
-   Relying on manual IP address management processes, such as spreadsheets.
    
-   Over- or under-sizing CIDR blocks, which results in IP address waste or insufficient address space for your workload.

## Benefits

Active planning of your network will ensure that you do not have multiple occurrences of the same IP address in interconnected networks. This prevents routing problems from occurring in parts of the workload that are using the different applications.

## Implementation Guidance

Make use of an IPAM, such as the [Amazon VPC IP Address Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/what-it-is-ipam.html), to monitor and manage your CIDR use. Several IPAMs are also available from the AWS Marketplace. Evaluate your potential usage on AWS, add CIDR ranges to existing VPCs, and create VPCs to allow planned growth in usage.

### Implementation steps

-   Capture current CIDR consumption (for example, VPCs and subnets).
    
    -   Use service API operations to collect current CIDR consumption.
        
    -   Use the [Amazon VPC IP Address Manager to discover resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/res-disc-work-with-view.html).
        
    
-   Capture your current subnet usage.
    
    -   Use service API operations to [collect subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSubnets.html) per VPC in each Region.
        
    -   Use the [Amazon VPC IP Address Manager to discover resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/res-disc-work-with-view.html).
        
    
-   Record the current usage.
    
-   Determine if you created any overlapping IP ranges.
    
-   Calculate the spare capacity.
    
-   Identify overlapping IP ranges. You can either migrate to a new range of addresses or consider using techniques like [private NAT Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/private-nat-gateway.html) or [AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/aws-privatelink.html) if you need to connect the overlapping ranges.
