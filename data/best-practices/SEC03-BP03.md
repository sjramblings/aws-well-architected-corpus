# SEC03-BP03 — Establish emergency access process

## Statement

Create a process that allows for emergency access to your workloads in the unlikely event of an issue with your centralized identity provider.

You must design processes for different failure modes that may result in an emergency event. For example, under normal circumstances, your workforce users federate to the cloud using a centralized identity provider ([SEC02-BP04](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_identity_provider.html)) to manage their workloads. However, if your centralized identity provider fails, or the configuration for federation in the cloud is modified, then your workforce users may not be able to federate into the cloud. An emergency access process allows authorized administrators to access your cloud resources through alternate means (such as an alternate form of federation or direct user access) to fix issues with your federation configuration or your workloads. The emergency access process is used until the normal federation mechanism is restored.

## Desired Outcome

-   You have defined and documented the failure modes that count as an emergency: consider your normal circumstances and the systems your users depend on to manage their workloads. Consider how each of these dependencies can fail and cause an emergency situation. You may find the questions and best practices in the [Reliability pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/a-reliability.html) useful to identify failure modes and architect more resilient systems to minimize the likelihood of failures.
    
-   You have documented the steps that must be followed to confirm a failure as an emergency. For example, you can require your identity administrators to check the status of your primary and standby identity providers and, if both are unavailable, declare an emergency event for identity provider failure.
    
-   You have defined an emergency access process specific to each type of emergency or failure mode. Being specific can reduce the temptation on the part of your users to overuse a general process for all types of emergencies. Your emergency access processes describe the circumstances under which each process should be used, and conversely situations where the process should not be used and points to alternate processes that may apply.
    
-   Your processes are well-documented with detailed instructions and playbooks that can be followed quickly and efficiently. Remember that an emergency event can be a stressful time for your users and they may be under extreme time pressure, so design your process to be as simple as possible.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You do not have well-documented and well-tested emergency access processes. Your users are unprepared for an emergency and follow improvised processes when an emergency event arises.
    
-   Your emergency access processes depend on the same systems (such as a centralized identity provider) as your normal access mechanisms. This means that the failure of such a system may impact both your normal and emergency access mechanisms and impair your ability to recover from the failure.
    
-   Your emergency access processes are used in non-emergency situations. For example, your users frequently misuse emergency access processes as they find it easier to make changes directly than submit changes through a pipeline.
    
-   Your emergency access processes do not generate sufficient logs to audit the processes, or the logs are not monitored to alert for potential misuse of the processes.

## Benefits

-   By having well-documented and well-tested emergency access processes, you can reduce the time taken by your users to respond to and resolve an emergency event. This can result in less downtime and higher availability of the services you provide to your customers.
    
-   You can track each emergency access request and detect and alert on unauthorized attempts to misuse the process for non-emergency events.

## Implementation Guidance

This section provides guidance for creating emergency access processes for several failure modes related to workloads deployed on AWS, starting with common guidance that applies to all failure modes and followed by specific guidance based on the type of failure mode.

**Common guidance for all failure modes**

Consider the following as you design an emergency access process for a failure mode:

-   Document the pre-conditions and assumptions of the process: when the process should be used and when it should not be used. It helps to detail the failure mode and document assumptions, such as the state of other related systems. For example, the process for the Failure Mode 2 assumes that the identity provider is available, but the configuration on AWS is modified or has expired.
    
-   Pre-create resources needed by the emergency access process ([SEC10-BP05](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html)). For example, pre-create the emergency access AWS account with IAM users and roles, and the cross-account IAM roles in all the workload accounts. This verifies that these resources are ready and available when an emergency event happens. By pre-creating resources, you do not have a dependency on AWS [control plane](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/control-planes-and-data-planes.html) APIs (used to create and modify AWS resources) that may be unavailable in an emergency. Further, by pre-creating IAM resources, you do not need to account for [potential delays due to eventual consistency.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency)
    
-   Include emergency access processes as part of your incident management plans ([SEC10-BP02](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_develop_management_plans.html)). Document how emergency events are tracked and communicated to others in your organization such as peer teams, your leadership, and, when applicable, externally to your customers and business partners.
    
-   Define the emergency access request process in your existing service request workflow system if you have one. Typically, such workflow systems allow you to create intake forms to collect information about the request, track the request through each stage of the workflow, and add both automated and manual approval steps. Relate each request with a corresponding emergency event tracked in your incident management system. Having a uniform system for emergency accesses allows you to track those requests in a single system, analyze usage trends, and improve your processes.
    
-   Verify that your emergency access processes can only be initiated by authorized users and require approvals from the user's peers or management as appropriate. The approval process should operate effectively both inside and outside business hours. Define how requests for approval allow secondary approvers if the primary approvers are unavailable and are escalated up your management chain until approved.
    
-   Implement robust logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms for the emergency access process and mechanisms. Generate detailed audit logs for all successful and failed attempts to gain emergency access. Correlate the activity with ongoing emergency events from your incident management system, and initiate alerts when actions occur outside of expected time periods or when the emergency access account is used during normal operations. The emergency access account should only be accessed during emergencies, as break-glass procedures can be considered a backdoor. Integrate with your security information and event management (SIEM) tool or [AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/) to report and audit all activities during the emergency access period. Upon returning to normal operations, automatically rotate the emergency access credentials, and notify the relevant teams.
    
-   Test emergency access processes periodically to verify that the steps are clear and grant the correct level of access quickly and efficiently. Your emergency access processes should be tested as part of incident response simulations ([SEC10-BP07](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_run_game_days.html)) and disaster recovery tests ([REL13-BP03](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_for_recovery_dr_tested.html)).
    

**Failure Mode 1: Identity provider used to federate to AWS is unavailable**

As described in [SEC02-BP04 Rely on a centralized identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_identity_provider.html), we recommend relying on a centralized identity provider to federate your workforce users to grant access to AWS accounts. You can federate to multiple AWS accounts in your AWS organization using IAM Identity Center, or you can federate to individual AWS accounts using IAM. In both cases, workforce users authenticate with your centralized identity provider before being redirected to an AWS sign-in endpoint to single sign-on.

In the unlikely event that your centralized identity provider is unavailable, your workforce users can't federate to AWS accounts or manage their workloads. In this emergency event, you can provide an emergency access process for a small set of administrators to access AWS accounts to perform critical tasks that cannot wait until your centralized identity providers are back online. For example, your identity provider is unavailable for 4 hours and during that period you need to modify the upper limits of an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group in a Production account to handle an unexpected spike in customer traffic. Your emergency administrators should follow the emergency access process to gain access to the specific production AWS account and make the necessary changes.

The emergency access process relies on a pre-created emergency access AWS account that is used solely for emergency access and has AWS resources (such as IAM roles and IAM users) to support the emergency access process. During normal operations, no one should access the emergency access account and you must monitor and alert on the misuse of this account (for more detail, see the preceding Common guidance section).

The emergency access account has emergency access IAM roles with permissions to assume cross-account roles in the AWS accounts that require emergency access. These IAM roles are pre-created and configured with trust policies that trust the emergency account's IAM roles.

The emergency access process can use one of the following approaches:

-   You can pre-create a set of [IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) for your emergency administrators in the emergency access account with associated strong passwords and MFA tokens. These IAM users have permissions to assume the IAM roles that then allow cross-account access to the AWS account where emergency access is required. We recommend creating as few such users as possible and assigning each user to a single emergency administrator. During an emergency, an emergency administrator user signs into the emergency access account using their password and MFA token code, switches to the emergency access IAM role in the emergency account, and finally switches to the emergency access IAM role in the workload account to perform the emergency change action. The advantage of this approach is that each IAM user is assigned to one emergency administrator and you can know which user signed-in by reviewing CloudTrail events. The disadvantage is that you have to maintain multiple IAM users with their associated long-lived passwords and MFA tokens.
    
-   You can use the emergency access [AWS account root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html) to sign into the emergency access account, assume the IAM role for emergency access, and assume the cross-account role in the workload account. We recommend setting a strong password and multiple MFA tokens for the root user. We also recommend storing the password and the MFA tokens in a secure enterprise credential vault that enforces strong authentication and authorization. You should secure the password and MFA token reset factors: set the email address for the account to an email distribution list that is monitored by your cloud security administrators, and the phone number of the account to a shared phone number that is also monitored by security administrators. The advantage of this approach is that there is one set of root user credentials to manage. The disadvantage is that since this is a shared user, multiple administrators have ability to sign in as the root user. You must audit your enterprise vault log events to identify which administrator checked out the root user password.
    

**Failure Mode 2: Identity provider configuration on AWS is modified or has expired**

To allow your workforce users to federate to AWS accounts, you can configure the IAM Identity Center with an external identity provider or create an IAM Identity Provider ([SEC02-BP04](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_identity_provider.html)). Typically, you configure these by importing a SAML meta-data XML document provided by your identity provider. The meta-data XML document includes a X.509 certificate corresponding to a private key that the identity provider uses to sign its SAML assertions.

These configurations on the AWS-side may be modified or deleted by mistake by an administrator. In another scenario, the X.509 certificate imported into AWS may expire and a new meta-data XML with a new certificate has not yet been imported into AWS. Both scenarios can break federation to AWS for your workforce users, resulting in an emergency.

In such an emergency event, you can provide your identity administrators access to AWS to fix the federation issues. For example, your identity administrator uses the emergency access process to sign into the emergency access AWS account, switches to a role in the Identity Center administrator account, and updates the external identity provider configuration by importing the latest SAML meta-data XML document from your identity provider to re-enable federation. Once federation is fixed, your workforce users continue to use the normal operating process to federate into their workload accounts.

You can follow the approaches detailed in the previous Failure Mode 1 to create an emergency access process. You can grant least-privilege permissions to your identity administrators to access only the Identity Center administrator account and perform actions on Identity Center in that account.

**Failure Mode 3: Identity Center disruption**

In the unlikely event of an IAM Identity Center or AWS Region disruption, we recommend that you set up a configuration that you can use to provide temporary access to the AWS Management Console.

The emergency access process uses direct federation from your identity provider to IAM in an emergency account. For detail on the process and design considerations, see [Set up emergency access to the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/emergency-access.html).

### Implementation steps

**Common steps for all failure modes**

-   Create an AWS account dedicated to emergency access processes. Pre-create the IAM resources needed in the account such as IAM roles or IAM users, and optionally IAM Identity Providers. Additionally, pre-create cross-account IAM roles in the workload AWS accounts with trust relationships with corresponding IAM roles in the emergency access account. You can use [CloudFormation StackSets with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-cloudformation.html) to create such resources in the member accounts in your organization.
    

-   Create AWS Organizations [service control policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) (SCPs) to deny the deletion and modification of the cross-account IAM roles in the member AWS accounts.
    
-   Enable CloudTrail for the emergency access AWS account and send the trail events to a central S3 bucket in your log collection AWS account. If you are using AWS Control Tower to set up and govern your AWS multi-account environment, then every account you create using AWS Control Tower or enroll in AWS Control Tower has CloudTrail enabled by default and sent to an S3 bucket in a dedicated log archive AWS account.
    
-   Monitor the emergency access account for activity by creating EventBridge rules that match on console login and API activity by the emergency IAM roles. Send notifications to your security operations center when activity happens outside of an ongoing emergency event tracked in your incident management system.
    

**Additional steps for Failure Mode 1: Identity provider used to federate to AWS is unavailable and Failure Mode 2: Identity provider configuration on AWS is modified or has expired**

-   Pre-create resources depending on the mechanism you choose for emergency access:
    
    -   **Using IAM users:** pre-create the IAM users with strong passwords and associated MFA devices.
        
    -   **Using the emergency account root user:** configure the root user with a strong password and store the password in your enterprise credential vault. Associate multiple physical MFA devices with the root user and store the devices in locations that can be accessed quickly by members of your emergency administrator team.
        
    

**Additional steps for Failure Mode 3: Identity center disruption**

-   As detailed in [Set up emergency access to the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/emergency-access.html), in the emergency access AWS account, create an IAM Identity Provider to enable direct SAML federation from your identity provider.
    
-   Create emergency operations groups in your IdP with no members.
    
-   Create IAM roles corresponding to the emergency operations groups in the emergency access account.
