# REL01-BP03 — Accommodate fixed service quotas and constraints through architecture

## Statement

Be aware of unchangeable service quotas, service constraints, and physical resource limits. Design architectures for applications and services to prevent these limits from impacting reliability.

Examples include network bandwidth, serverless function invocation payload size, throttle burst rate for of an API gateway, and concurrent user connections to a database.

## Desired Outcome

The application or service performs as expected under normal and high traffic conditions. They have been designed to work within the limitations for that resource’s fixed constraints or service quotas.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   Choosing a design that uses a resource of a service, unaware that there are design constraints that will cause this design to fail as you scale.
    
-   Performing benchmarking that is unrealistic and will reach service fixed quotas during the testing. For example, running tests at a burst limit but for an extended amount of time.
    
-   Choosing a design that cannot scale or be modified if fixed service quotas are to be exceeded. For example, an SQS payload size of 256KB.
    
-   Observability has not been designed and implemented to monitor and alert on thresholds for service quotas that might be at risk during high traffic events

## Benefits

Verifying that the application will run under all projected services load levels without disruption or degradation.

## Implementation Guidance

Unlike soft service quotas or resources that be replaced with higher capacity units, AWS services’ fixed quotas cannot be changed. This means that all these type of AWS services must be evaluated for potential hard capacity limits when used in an application design.

Hard limits are shown in the Service Quotas console. If the columns shows `ADJUSTABLE = No`, the service has a hard limit. Hard limits are also shown in some resources configuration pages. For example, Lambda has specific hard limits that cannot be adjusted.

As an example, when designing a python application to run in a Lambda function, the application should be evaluated to determine if there is any chance of Lambda running longer than 15 minutes. If the code may run more than this service quota limit, alternate technologies or designs must be considered. If this limit is reached after production deployment, the application will suffer degradation and disruption until it can be remediated. Unlike soft quotas, there is no method to change to these limits even under emergency Severity 1 events.

Once the application has been deployed to a testing environment, strategies should be used to find if any hard limits can be reached. Stress testing, load testing, and chaos testing should be part of the introduction test plan.

**Implementation steps**

-   Review the complete list of AWS services that could be used in the application design phase.
    
-   Review the soft quota limits and hard quota limits for all these services. Not all limits are shown in the Service Quotas console. Some services [describe these limits in alternate locations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html).
    
-   As you design your application, review your workload’s business and technology drivers, such as business outcomes, use case, dependent systems, availability targets, and disaster recovery objects. Let your business and technology drivers guide the process to identify the distributed system that is right for your workload.
    
-   Analyze service load across Regions and accounts. Many hard limits are regionally based for services. However, some limits are account based.
    
-   Analyze resilience architectures for resource usage during a zonal failure and Regional failure. In the progression of multi-Region designs using active/active, active/passive – hot, active/passive - cold, and active/passive - pilot light approaches, these failure cases will cause higher usage. This creates a potential use case for hitting hard limits.
