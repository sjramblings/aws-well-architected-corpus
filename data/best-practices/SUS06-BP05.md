# SUS06-BP05 — Use managed device farms for testing

## Statement

Use managed device farms to efficiently test a new feature on a representative set of hardware.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You manually test and deploy your application on individual physical devices.
    
-   You do not use app testing service to test and interact with your apps (for example, Android, iOS, and web apps) on real, physical devices.

## Benefits

Using managed device farms for testing cloud-enabled applications provides a number of benefits:

-   They include more efficient features to test application on wide range of devices.
    
-   They eliminate the need for in-house infrastructure for testing.
    
-   They offer diverse device types, including older and less popular hardware, which eliminates the need for unnecessary device upgrades.

## Implementation Guidance

Using Managed device farms can help you to streamline the testing process for new features on a representative set of hardware. Managed device farms offer diverse device types including older, less popular hardware, and avoid customer sustainability impact from unnecessary device upgrades.

### Implementation steps

-   **Define testing requirements**: Define your testing requirements and plan (like test type, operating systems, and test schedule).
    
    -   You can use [Amazon CloudWatch RUM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM.html) to collect and analyze client-side data and shape your testing plan.
        
    
-   **Select a managed device farm:** Select a managed device farm that can support your testing requirements. For example, you can use [AWS Device Farm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/welcome.html) to test and understand the impact of your changes on a representative set of hardware.
    
-   **Use automation:** Use automation and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) to schedule and run your tests.

-   **Review and adjust:** Continually review your testing results and make necessary improvements.
