# REL02-BP03 — Ensure IP subnet allocation accounts for expansion and availability

## Statement

Amazon VPC IP address ranges must be large enough to accommodate workload requirements, including factoring in future expansion and allocation of IP addresses to subnets across Availability Zones. This includes load balancers, EC2 instances, and container-based applications.

When you plan your network topology, the first step is to define the IP address space itself. Private IP address ranges (following RFC 1918 guidelines) should be allocated for each VPC. Accommodate the following requirements as part of this process:

-   Allow IP address space for more than one VPC per Region.
    
-   Within a VPC, allow space for multiple subnets so that you can cover multiple Availability Zones.
    
-   Consider leaving unused CIDR block space within a VPC for future expansion.
    
-   Ensure that there is IP address space to meet the needs of any transient fleets of Amazon EC2 instances that you might use, such as Spot Fleets for machine learning, Amazon EMR clusters, or Amazon Redshift clusters. Similar consideration should be given to Kubernetes clusters, such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), as each Kubernetes pod is assigned a routable address from the VPC CIDR block by default.
    
-   Note that the first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are reserved and not available for your use.
    
-   Note that the initial VPC CIDR block allocated to your VPC cannot be changed or deleted, but you can add additional non-overlapping CIDR blocks to the VPC. Subnet IPv4 CIDRs cannot be changed, however IPv6 CIDRs can.
    
-   The largest possible VPC CIDR block is a /16, and the smallest is a /28.
    
-   Consider other connected networks (VPC, on-premises, or other cloud providers) and ensure non-overlapping IP address space. For more information, see [REL02-BP05 Enforce non-overlapping private IP address ranges in all private address spaces where they are connected.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_network_topology_non_overlap_ip.html)

## Desired Outcome

A scalable IP subnet can help you accomodate for future growth and avoid unnecessary waste.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   Failing to consider future growth, resulting in CIDR blocks that are too small and requiring reconfiguration, potentially causing downtime.
    
-   Incorrectly estimating how many IP addresses an elastic load balancer can use.
    
-   Deploying many high traffic load balancers into the same subnets
    
-   Using automated scaling mechanisms whilst failing to monitor IP address consumption.
    
-   Defining excessively large CIDR ranges well beyond future growth expectations, which can lead to difficulty peering with other networks with overlapping address ranges.

## Benefits

This ensures that you can accommodate the growth of your workloads and continue to provide availability as you scale up.

## Implementation Guidance

Plan your network to accommodate for growth, regulatory compliance, and integration with others. Growth can be underestimated, regulatory compliance can change, and acquisitions or private network connections can be difficult to implement without proper planning.

-   Select relevant AWS accounts and Regions based on your service requirements, latency, regulatory, and disaster recovery (DR) requirements.
    
-   Identify your needs for regional VPC deployments.
    
-   Identify the size of the VPCs.
    
    -   Determine if you are going to deploy multi-VPC connectivity.

        -   [Single Region Multi-VPC Connectivity](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/networking/aws-single-region-multi-vpc-connectivity/)
            
        
    -   Determine if you need segregated networking for regulatory requirements.
        
    -   Make VPCs with appropriately-sized CIDR blocks to accommodate your current and future needs.
        
        -   If you have unknown growth projections, you may wish to err on the side of larger CIDR blocks to reduce the potential for future reconfiguration
            
        
    -   Consider using [IPv6 addressing](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/ipv6/) for subnets as part of a dual-stack VPC. IPv6 is well suited to being used in private subnets containing fleets of ephemeral instances or containers that would otherwise require large numbers of IPv4 addresses.
