# REL06-BP01 — Monitor all components for the workload (Generation)

## Statement

Monitor the components of the workload with Amazon CloudWatch or third-party tools. Monitor AWS services with AWS Health Dashboard.

All components of your workload should be monitored, including the front-end, business logic, and storage tiers. Define key metrics, describe how to extract them from logs (if necessary), and set thresholds for invoking corresponding alarm events. Ensure metrics are relevant to the key performance indicators (KPIs) of your workload, and use metrics and logs to identify early warning signs of service degradation. For example, a metric related to business outcomes such as the number of orders successfully processed per minute, can indicate workload issues faster than technical metric, such as CPU Utilization. Use AWS Health Dashboard for a personalized view into the performance and availability of the AWS services underlying your AWS resources.

Monitoring in the cloud offers new opportunities. Most cloud providers have developed customizable hooks and can deliver insights to help you monitor multiple layers of your workload. AWS services such as Amazon CloudWatch apply statistical and machine learning algorithms to continually analyze metrics of systems and applications, determine normal baselines, and surface anomalies with minimal user intervention. Anomaly detection algorithms account for the seasonality and trend changes of metrics.

AWS makes an abundance of monitoring and log information available for consumption that can be used to define workload-specific metrics, change-in-demand processes, and adopt machine learning techniques regardless of ML expertise.

In addition, monitor all of your external endpoints to ensure that they are independent of your base implementation. This active monitoring can be done with synthetic transactions (sometimes referred to as _user canaries_, but not to be confused with canary deployments) which periodically run a number of common tasks matching actions performed by clients of the workload. Keep these tasks short in duration and be sure not to overload your workload during testing. Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics allows you to [create synthetic canaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html) to monitor your endpoints and APIs. You can also combine the synthetic canary client nodes with AWS X-Ray console to pinpoint which synthetic canaries are experiencing issues with errors, faults, or throttling rates for the selected time frame.

## Desired Outcome

Collect and use critical metrics from all components of the workload to ensure workload reliability and optimal user experience. Detecting that a workload is not achieving business outcomes allows you to quickly declare a disaster and recover from an incident.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   Only monitoring external interfaces to your workload.
    
-   Not generating any workload-specific metrics and only relying on metrics provided to you by the AWS services your workload uses.
    
-   Only using technical metrics in your workload and not monitoring any metrics related to non-technical KPIs the workload contributes to.
    
-   Relying on production traffic and simple health checks to monitor and evaluate workload state.

## Benefits

Monitoring at all tiers in your workload allows you to more rapidly anticipate and resolve problems in the components that comprise the workload.

## Implementation Guidance

1.  **Turn on logging where available.** Monitoring data should be obtained from all components of the workloads. Turn on additional logging, such as S3 Access Logs, and permit your workload to log workload specific data. Collect metrics for CPU, network I/O, and disk I/O averages from services such as Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, AWS Auto Scaling, and Amazon EMR. See [AWS Services That Publish CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CW_Support_For_AWS.html) for a list of AWS services that publish metrics to CloudWatch.
    
2.  **Review all default metrics and explore any data collection gaps.** Every service generates default metrics. Collecting default metrics allows you to better understand the dependencies between workload components, and how component reliability and performance affect the workload. You can also create and [publish your own metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html) to CloudWatch using the AWS CLI or an API.
    
3.  **Evaluate all the metrics to decide which ones to alert on for each AWS service in your workload.** You may choose to select a subset of metrics that have a major impact on workload reliability. Focusing on critical metrics and threshold allows you to refine the number of [alerts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) and can help minimize false-positives.
    
4.  **Define alerts and the recovery process for your workload after the alert is invoked.** Defining alerts allows you to quickly notify, escalate, and follow steps necessary to recover from an incident and meet your prescribed Recovery Time Objective (RTO). You can use [Amazon CloudWatch Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarms-and-actions) to invoke automated workflows and initiate recovery procedures based on defined thresholds.
    
5.  **Explore use of synthetic transactions to collect relevant data about workloads state.** Synthetic monitoring follows the same routes and perform the same actions as a customer, which makes it possible for you to continually verify your customer experience even when you don't have any customer traffic on your workloads. By using [synthetic transactions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html), you can discover issues before your customers do.
