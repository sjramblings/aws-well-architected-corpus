# SEC03-BP09 — Share resources securely with a third party

## Statement

The security of your cloud environment doesn't stop at your organization. Your organization might rely on a third party to manage a portion of your data. The permission management for the third-party managed system should follow the practice of just-in-time access using the principle of least privilege with temporary credentials. By working closely with a third party, you can reduce the scope of impact and risk of unintended access together.

## Desired Outcome

You avoid using long-term AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials like access keys and secret keys, as they pose a security risk if misused. Instead, you use IAM roles and temporary credentials to improve your security posture and minimize the operational overhead of managing long-term credentials. When granting third-party access, you use a universally unique identifier (UUID) as the external ID in the IAM trust policy and keep the IAM policies attached to the role under your control to ensure least privilege access. For prescriptive guidance on analyzing externally shared resources, see [SEC03-BP07 Analyze public and cross-account access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_analyze_cross_account.html).

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   Using the default IAM trust policy without any conditions.
    
-   Using long-term IAM credentials and access keys.
    
-   Reusing external IDs.

## Implementation Guidance

You might want to allow sharing resources outside of AWS Organizations or grant a third party access to your account. For example, a third party might provide a monitoring solution that needs to access resources within your account. In those cases, create an IAM cross-account role with only the privileges needed by the third party. Additionally, define a trust policy using the [external ID condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html). When using an external ID, you or the third party can generate a unique ID for each customer, third party, or tenancy. The unique ID should not be controlled by anyone but you after it's created. The third party must implement a process to relate the external ID to the customer in a secure, auditable, and reproduceable manner.

You can also use [IAM Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) to manage IAM roles for applications outside of AWS that use AWS APIs.

If the third party no longer requires access to your environment, remove the role. Avoid providing long-term credentials to a third party. Maintain awareness of other AWS services that support sharing, such as the AWS Well-Architected Tool allowing [sharing a workload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/workloads-sharing.html) with other AWS accounts, and [AWS Resource Access Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html) helping you securely share an AWS resource you own with other accounts.

### Implementation steps

1.  **Use cross-account roles to provide access to external accounts.** [Cross-account roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html) reduce the amount of sensitive information that is stored by external accounts and third parties for servicing their customers. Cross-account roles allow you to grant access to AWS resources in your account securely to a third party, such as AWS Partners or other accounts in your organization, while maintaining the ability to manage and audit that access. The third party might be providing service to you from a hybrid infrastructure or alternatively pulling data into an offsite location. [IAM Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) helps you allow third-party workloads to securely interact with your AWS workloads and further reduce the need for long-term credentials.
    
    You should not use long-term credentials or access keys associated with users to provide external account access. Instead, use cross-account roles to provide the cross-account access.
    
2.  **Perform due diligence and ensure secure access for third-party SaaS providers.** When sharing resources with third-party SaaS providers, perform thorough due diligence to ensure they have a secure and responsible approach to accessing your AWS resources. Evaluate their shared responsibility model to understand what security measures they provide and what falls under your responsibility. Ensure that the SaaS provider has a secure and auditable process for accessing your resources, including the use of [external IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) and least privilege access principles. The use of external IDs helps address the [confused deputy problem](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-external-id-when-granting-access-to-your-aws-resources/).
    
    Implement security controls to ensure secure access and adherence to the principle of least privilege when granting access to third-party SaaS providers. This may include the use of external IDs, universally unique identifiers (UUIDs), and IAM trust policies that limit access to only what is strictly necessary. Work closely with the SaaS provider to establish secure access mechanisms, regularly review their access to your AWS resources, and conduct audits to ensure compliance with your security requirements.
    
3.  **Deprecate customer-provided long-term credentials.** Deprecate the use of long-term credentials and use cross-account roles or IAM Roles Anywhere. If you must use long-term credentials, establish a plan to migrate to role-based access. For details on managing keys, see [Identity management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/identity-management.html). Also, work with your AWS account team and the third party to establish a risk mitigation runbook. For prescriptive guidance on responding to and mitigating the potential impact of a security incident, see [Incident response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/incident-response.html).
    
4.  **Verify that setup has prescriptive guidance or is automated.** The external ID is not treated as a secret, but the external ID must not be an easily guessable value, such as a phone number, name, or account ID. Make the external ID a read-only field so that the external ID cannot be changed for the purpose of impersonating the setup.
    
    You or the third party can generate the external ID. Define a process to determine who is responsible for generating the ID. Regardless of the entity creating the external ID, the third party enforces uniqueness and formats consistently across customers.
    
    The policy created for cross-account access in your accounts must follow the [least-privilege principle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). The third party must provide a role policy document or automated setup mechanism that uses an AWS CloudFormation template or an equivalent for you. This reduces the chance of errors associated with manual policy creation and offers an auditable trail. For more information on using an AWS CloudFormation template to create cross-account roles, see [Cross-Account Roles](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/tag/cross-account-roles/).
    
    The third party should provide an automated, auditable setup mechanism. However, by using the role policy document outlining the access needed, you should automate the setup of the role. Using an AWS CloudFormation template or equivalent, you should monitor for changes with drift detection as part of the audit practice.
    
5.  **Account for changes.** Your account structure, your need for the third party, or their service offering being provided might change. You should anticipate changes and failures, and plan accordingly with the right people, process, and technology. Audit the level of access you provide on a periodic basis, and implement detection methods to alert you to unexpected changes. Monitor and audit the use of the role and the datastore of the external IDs. You should be prepared to revoke third-party access, either temporarily or permanently, as a result of unexpected changes or access patterns. Also, measure the impact to your revocation operation, including the time it takes to perform, the people involved, the cost, and the impact to other resources.
    
    For prescriptive guidance on detection methods, see the [Detection best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/detection.html).
