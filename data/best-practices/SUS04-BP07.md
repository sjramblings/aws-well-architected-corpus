# SUS04-BP07 — Minimize data movement across networks

## Statement

Use shared file systems or object storage to access common data and minimize the total networking resources required to support data movement for your workload.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You store all data in the same AWS Region independent of where the data users are.
    
-   You do not optimize data size and format before moving it over the network.

## Benefits

Optimizing data movement across the network reduces the total networking resources required for the workload and lowers its environmental impact.

## Implementation Guidance

Moving data around your organization requires compute, networking, and storage resources. Use techniques to minimize data movement and improve the overall efficiency of your workload.

## Implementation steps

-   **Use proximity:** Consider proximity to the data or users as a decision factor when [selecting a Region for your workload](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/how-to-select-a-region-for-your-workload-based-on-sustainability-goals/).
    
-   **Partition services:** Partition Regionally-consumed services so that their Region-specific data is stored within the Region where it is consumed.
    
-   **Use efficient file formats:** Use efficient file formats (such as Parquet or ORC) and compress data before you move it over the network.
    
-   **Minimize data movement:** Don't move unused data. Some examples that can help you avoid moving unused data:
    
    -   Reduce API responses to only relevant data.
        
    -   Aggregate data where detailed (record-level information is not required).
        
    -   See [Well-Architected Lab - Optimize Data Pattern Using Amazon Redshift Data Sharing](https://catalog.workshops.aws/well-architected-sustainability/en-US/3-data/optimize-data-pattern-using-redshift-data-sharing).
        
    -   Consider [Cross-account data sharing in AWS Lake Formation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/cross-account-permissions.html).
        
    
-   **Use edge services:** Use services that can help you run code closer to users of your workload.

    When to use
    
    [Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/)
    
    Use for compute-heavy operations that are run when objects are not in the cache.
    
    [CloudFront Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-functions.html)
    
    Use for simple use cases such as HTTP(s) request/response manipulations that can be initiated by short-lived functions.
    
    [AWS IoT Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/)
    
    Run local compute, messaging, and data caching for connected devices.
