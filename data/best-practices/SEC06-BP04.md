# SEC06-BP04 — Validate software integrity

## Statement

Use cryptographic verification to validate the integrity of software artifacts (including images) your workload uses.  Cryptographically sign your software as a safeguard against unauthorized changes run within your compute environments.

## Desired Outcome

All artifacts are obtained from trusted sources. Vendor website certificates are validated.  Downloaded artifacts are cryptographically verified by their signatures. Your own software is cryptographically signed and verified by your computing environments.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   Trusting reputable vendor websites to obtain software artifacts, but ignoring certificate expiration notices.  Proceeding with downloads without confirming certificates are valid.
    
-   Validating vendor website certificates, but not cryptographically verifying downloaded artifacts from these websites.
    
-   Relying solely on digests or hashes to validate software integrity.  Hashes establish that artifacts have not been modified from the original version, but do not validate their source.
    
-   Not signing your own software, code, or libraries, even when only used in your own deployments.

## Benefits

Validating the integrity of artifacts that your workload depends on helps prevent malware from entering your compute environments.  Signing your software helps safeguard against unauthorized running in your compute environments.   Secure your software supply chain by signing and verifying code.

## Implementation Guidance

Operating system images, container images, and code artifacts are often distributed with integrity checks available, such as through a digest or hash.  These allow clients to verify integrity by computing their own hash of the payload and validating it is the same as the one published.  While these checks help verify that the payload has not been tampered with, they do not validate the payload came from the original source (its _provenance_).  Verifying provenance requires a certificate that a trusted authority issues to digitally sign the artifact.

If you are using a downloaded software or artifacts in your workload, check if the provider provides a public key for digital signature verification.  Here are some examples of how AWS provides a public key and verification instructions for software we publish:

-   [EC2 Image Builder: Verify the signature of the AWSTOE installation download](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/awstoe-verify-sig.html)
    
-   [AWS Systems Manager: Verifying the signature of SSM Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/verify-agent-signature.html)
    
-   [Amazon CloudWatch: Verifying the signature of the CloudWatch agent package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/verify-CloudWatch-Agent-Package-Signature.html)
    

Incorporate digital signature verification into the processes you use for obtaining and hardening images, as discussed in [SEC06-BP02 Provision compute from hardened images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_protect_compute_hardened_images.html).

You can use [AWS Signer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html) to help manage the verification of signatures, as well as your own code-signing lifecycle for your own software and artifacts.  Both [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) provide integrations with Signer to verify the signatures of your code and images.  Using the examples in the Resources section, you can incorporate Signer into your continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to automate verification of signatures and the signing of your own code and images.
