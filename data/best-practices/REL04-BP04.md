# REL04-BP04 — Make mutating operations idempotent

## Statement

An idempotent service promises that each request is processed exactly once, such that making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request. This makes it easier for a client to implement retries without fear that a request is erroneously processed multiple times. To do this, clients can issue API requests with an idempotency token, which is used whenever the request is repeated. An idempotent service API uses the token to return a response identical to the response that was returned the first time that the request was completed, even if the underlying state of the system has changed.

In a distributed system, it is relatively simple to perform an action at most once (client makes only one request) or at least once (keep requesting until client gets confirmation of success). It is more difficult to guarantee an action is performed _exactly once_, such that making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request. Using idempotency tokens in APIs, services can receive a mutating request one or more times without the need to create duplicate records or side effects.

## Desired Outcome

You have a consistent, well-documented, and widely adopted approach for ensuring idempotency across all components and services.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You apply idempotency indiscriminately, even when not needed.
    
-   You introduce overly complex logic for implementing idempotency.
    
-   You use timestamps as keys for idempotency. This can cause inaccuracies due to clock skew or due to multiple clients that use the same timestamps to apply changes.
    
-   You store entire payloads for idempotency. In this approach, you save complete data payloads for every request and overwrite it at each new request. This can degrade performance and affect scalability.
    
-   You generate keys inconsistently across services. Without consistent keys, services may fail to recognize duplicate requests, which results in unintended results.

## Benefits

-   Greater scalability: The system can handle retries and duplicate requests without having to perform additional logic or complex state management.
    
-   Enhanced reliability: Idempotency helps services handle multiple identical requests in a consistent manner, which reduces the risk of unintended side effects or duplicate records. This is especially crucial in distributed systems, where network failures and retries are common.
    
-   Improved data consistency: Because the same request produces the same response, idempotency helps maintain data consistency across distributed systems. This is essential to maintain the integrity of transactions and operations.
    
-   Error handling: Idempotency tokens make error handling more straightforward. If a client does not receive a response due to an issue, it can safely resend the request with the same idempotency token.
    
-   Operational transparency: Idempotency allows for better monitoring and logging. Services can log requests with their idempotency tokens, which makes it easier to trace and debug issues.
    
-   Simplified API contract: It can simplify the contract between the client and server side systems and reduce the fear of erroneous data processing.

## Implementation Guidance

In a distributed system, performing an action at most once (the client makes only one request) or at least once (the client keeps requesting until success is confirmed) is relatively straightforward. However, it's challenging to implement _exactly once_ behavior. To achieve this, your clients should generate and provide an idempotency token for each request.

By using idempotency tokens, a service can distinguish between new requests and repeated ones. When a service receives a request with an idempotency token, it checks if the token has already been used. If the token has been used, the service retrieves and returns the stored response. If the token is new, the service processes the request, stores the response along with the token, and then returns the response. This mechanism makes all responses idempotent, which enhances the reliability and consistency of the distributed system.

Idempotency is also an important behavior of event-driven architectures. These architectures are typically backed by a message queue such as Amazon SQS, Amazon MQ, Amazon Kinesis Streams, or Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK). In some circumstances, a message that was published only once may be accidentally delivered more than once. When a publisher generates and includes idempotency tokens in messages, it requests that the processing of any duplicate message received doesn't result in a repeated action for the same message. Consumers should keep track of each token received and ignore messages that contain duplicate tokens.

Services and consumers should also pass the received idempotency token to any downstream services that it calls. Every downstream service in the processing chain is similarly responsible for making sure that idempotency is implemented to avoid the side effect of processing a message more than once.

### Implementation steps

1.  **Identify idempotent operations**
    
    Determine which operations require idempotency. These typically include POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods and database insert, update, or delete operations. Operations that do not mutate state, such as read-only queries, usually do not require idempotency unless they have side effects.
    
2.  **Use unique identifiers**
    
    Include a unique token in each idempotent operation request sent by the sender, either directly in the request or as part of its metadata (for example, an HTTP header). This allows the receiver to recognize and handle duplicate requests or operations. Identifiers commonly used for tokens include [Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9562) and [K-Sortable Unique Identifiers (KSUIDs)](https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid).
    
3.  **Track and manage state**
    
    Maintain the state of each operation or request in your workload. This can be achieved by storing the idempotency token and the corresponding state (such as pending, completed, or failed) in a database, cache, or other persistent store. This state information allows the workload to identify and handle duplicate requests or operations.
    
    Maintain consistency and atomicity by using appropriate concurrency control mechanisms if needed, such as locks, transactions, or optimistic concurrency controls. This includes the process of recording the idempotent token and running all mutating operations associated with servicing the request. This helps prevent race conditions and verifies that idempotent operations run correctly.
    
    Regularly remove old idempotency tokens from the datastore to manage storage and performance. If your storage system supports it, consider using expiration timestamps for data (often known as time to live, or TTL values). The likelihood of idempotency token reuse diminishes over time.
    
    Common AWS storage options typically used for storing idempotency tokens and related state include:
    
    -   **Amazon DynamoDB**: DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service that provides low-latency performance and high availability, which makes it well-suited for the storage of idempotency-related data. The key-value and document data model of DynamoDB allows for efficient storage and retrieval of idempotency tokens and associated state information. DynamoDB can also expire idempotency tokens automatically if your application sets a TTL value when it inserts them.
        
    -   **Amazon ElastiCache**: ElastiCache can store idempotency tokens with high throughput, low latency, and at low cost. Both ElastiCache (Redis) and ElastiCache (Memcached) can also expire idempotency tokens automatically if your application sets a TTL value when it inserts them.
        
    -   **Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS):** You can use Amazon RDS to store idempotency tokens and related state information, especially if your application already uses a relational database for other purposes.
        
    -   **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3):** Amazon S3 is a highly scalable and durable object storage service that can be used to store idempotency tokens and related metadata. The versioning capabilities of S3 can be particularly useful for maintenance of the state of idempotent operations. The choice of storage service typically depends on factors such as the volume of idempotency-related data, the required performance characteristics, the need for durability and availability, and how the idempotency mechanism integrates with the overall workload architecture.
        
    
4.  **Implement idempotent operations**
    
    Design your API and workload components to be idempotent. Incorporate idempotency checks into your workload components. Before you process a request or perform an operation, check if the unique identifier has already been processed. If it has, return the previous result instead of executing the operation again. For example, if a client sends a request to create a user, check if a user with the same unique identifier already exists. If the user exists, it should return the existing user information instead of creating a new one. Similarly, if a queue consumer receives a message with a duplicate idempotency token, the consumer should ignore the message.
    
    Create comprehensive test suites that validate the idempotency of requests. They should cover a wide range of scenarios, such as successful requests, failed requests, and duplicate requests.
    
    If your workload leverages AWS Lambda functions, consider Powertools for AWS Lambda. Powertools for AWS Lambda is a developer toolkit that helps implement serverless best practices and increase developer velocity when you work with AWS Lambda functions. In particular, it provides a utility to convert your Lambda functions into idempotent operations which are safe to retry.
    
5.  **Communicate idempotency clearly**
    
    Document your API and workload components to clearly communicate the idempotent nature of the operations. This helps clients understand the expected behavior and how to interact with your workload reliably.
    
6.  **Monitor and audit**
    
    Implement monitoring and auditing mechanisms to detect any issues related to the idempotency of responses, such as unexpected response variations or excessive duplicate request handling. This can help you detect and investigate any issues or unexpected behaviors in your workload.
