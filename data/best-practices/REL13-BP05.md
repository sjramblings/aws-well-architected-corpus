# REL13-BP05 — Automate recovery

## Statement

Implement tested and automated recovery mechanisms that are reliable, observable, and reproducible to reduce the risk and business impact of failure.

## Desired Outcome

You have implemented a well-documented, standardized, and thoroughly-tested automation workflow for recovery processes. Your recovery automation automatically corrects minor issues that pose low risk of data loss or unavailability. You are able to quickly invoke recovery processes for serious incidents, observe the remediation behavior while they operate, and end the processes if you observe dangerous situations or failures.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You depend on components or mechanisms that are in a failed or degraded state as part of your recovery plan.
    
-   Your recovery processes require manual intervention, such as console access (also known as _click ops_).
    
-   You automatically initiate recovery procedures in situations that present a high risk of data loss or unavailability.
    
-   You fail to include a mechanism to abort a recovery procedure (like an _Andon cord_ or _big red stop button_) that is not working or that poses additional risks.

## Benefits

-   Increased reliability, predictability, and consistency of recovery operations.
    
-   Ability to meet more stringent recovery objectives, including Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
    
-   Reduced likelihood of recovery failing during an incident.
    
-   Reduced risk of failures associated with manual recovery processes that are prone to human error.

## Implementation Guidance

To implement automated recovery, you need a comprehensive approach that uses AWS services and best practices. To start, identify critical components and potential failure points in your workload. Develop automated processes that can recover your workloads and data from failures without human intervention.

Develop your recovery automation using infrastructure as code (IaC) principles. This makes your recovery environment consistent with the source environment and allows for version control of your recovery processes. To orchestrate complex recovery workflows, consider solutions such as [AWS Systems Manager Automations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html) or [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/).

Automation of recovery processes provides significant benefits and can help you more easily achieve your Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO). However, they can encounter unexpected situations that may cause them to fail or create new risks of their own such as additional downtime and data loss. To mitigate this risk, provide the ability to quickly halt a recovery automation in progress. Once halted, you can investigate and take corrective steps.

For supported workloads, consider solutions such as AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) to provide automated failover. AWS DRS continually replicates your machines (including operating system, system state configuration, databases, applications, and files) into a staging area in your target AWS account and preferred Region. If an incident occurs, AWS DRS automates the conversion of your replicated servers into fully-provisioned workloads in your recovery Region on AWS.

Maintenance and improvement of automated recovery is an ongoing process. Continually test and refine your recovery procedures based on lessons learned, and stay updated on new AWS services and features that can enhance your recovery capabilities.

### Implementation steps

1.  **Plan for automated recovery**
    
    1.  Conduct a thorough review of your workload architecture, components, and dependencies to identify and plan automated recovery mechanisms. Categorize your workload's dependencies into _hard_ and _soft_ dependencies. Hard dependencies are those that the workload cannot operate without and for which no substitute can be provided. Soft dependencies are those that the workload ordinarily uses but are replaceable with temporary substitute systems or processes or can be handled by [graceful degradation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_mitigate_interaction_failure_graceful_degradation).
        
    2.  Establish processes to identify and recover missing or corrupted data.
        
    3.  Define steps to confirm a recovered steady state after recovery actions have been completed.
        
    4.  Consider any actions required to make the recovered system ready for full service, such as pre-warming and populating caches.
        
    5.  Consider problems that could be encountered during the recovery process and how to detect and remediate them.
        
    6.  Consider scenarios where the primary site and its control plane are inaccessible. Verify that recovery actions can be performed independently without reliance on the primary site. Consider solutions such as [Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC)](https://aws.amazon.com/application-recovery-controller/) to redirect traffic without the need to manually mutate DNS records.
        
    
2.  **Develop automated recovery process**
    
    1.  Implement automated fault detection and failover mechanisms for hands-free recovery. Build dashboards such as with [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to report the progress and health of automated recovery procedures. Include procedures to validate successful recovery. Provide a mechanism to abort a recovery in process.
        
    2.  Build [playbooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_testing_resiliency_playbook_resiliency) as a fallback process for faults that cannot be automatically recovered from, and take into consideration your [disaster recovery plan](https://aws.amazon.com/disaster-recovery/faqs/#Core_concepts).
        
    3.  Test recovery processes as discussed in [REL13-BP03](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_planning_for_recovery_dr_tested.html).
        
    
3.  **Prepare for recovery**
    
    1.  Evaluate the state of your recovery site and deploy critical components to it in advance. For more detail, see [REL13-BP04](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_for_recovery_config_drift.html).
        
    2.  Define clear roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes for recovery operations, involving relevant stakeholders and teams across the organization.
        
    3.  Define the conditions to initiate your recovery processes.
        
    4.  Create a plan to revert the recovery process and fall back to your primary site if required or after it's considered safe.
