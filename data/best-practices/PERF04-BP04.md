# PERF04-BP04 — Use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple resources

## Statement

Distribute traffic across multiple resources or services to allow your workload to take advantage of the elasticity that the cloud provides. You can also use load balancing for offloading encryption termination to improve performance, reliability and manage and route traffic effectively.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You don’t consider your workload requirements when choosing the load balancer type.
    
-   You don’t leverage the load balancer features for performance optimization.
    
-   The workload is exposed directly to the internet without a load balancer.
    
-   You route all internet traffic through existing load balancers.
    
-   You use generic TCP load balancing and making each compute node handle SSL encryption.

## Benefits

A load balancer handles the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones and enables high availability, automatic scaling, and better utilization for your workload.

## Implementation Guidance

Load balancers act as the entry point for your workload, from which point they distribute the traffic to your backend targets, such as compute instances or containers, to improve utilization.

Choosing the right load balancer type is the first step to optimize your architecture. Start by listing your workload characteristics, such as protocol (like TCP, HTTP, TLS, or WebSockets), target type (like instances, containers, or serverless), application requirements (like long running connections, user authentication, or stickiness), and placement (like Region, Local Zone, Outpost, or zonal isolation).

AWS provides multiple models for your applications to use load balancing. [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers.

[Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html) is best suited for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required. It is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies, and it is optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.

[Elastic Load Balancing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) provides integrated certificate management and SSL/TLS decryption, allowing you the flexibility to centrally manage the SSL settings of the load balancer and offload CPU intensive work from your workload.

After choosing the right load balancer, you can start leveraging its features to reduce the amount of effort your backend has to do to serve the traffic.

For example, using both Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB), you can perform SSL/TLS encryption offloading, which is an opportunity to avoid the CPU-intensive TLS handshake from being completed by your targets and also to improve certificate management.

When you configure SSL/TLS offloading in your load balancer, it becomes responsible for the encryption of the traffic from and to clients while delivering the traffic unencrypted to your backends, freeing up your backend resources and improving the response time for the clients.

Application Load Balancer can also serve HTTP/2 traffic without needing to support it on your targets. This simple decision can improve your application response time, as HTTP/2 uses TCP connections more efficiently.

Your workload latency requirements should be considered when defining the architecture. As an example, if you have a latency-sensitive application, you may decide to use Network Load Balancer, which offers extremely low latencies. Alternatively, you may decide to bring your workload closer to your customers by leveraging Application Load Balancer in [AWS Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/) or even [AWS Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/rack/).

Another consideration for latency-sensitive workloads is cross-zone load balancing. With cross-zone load balancing, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all allowed Availability Zones.

Use Auto Scaling integrated with your load balancer. One of the key aspects of a performance efficient system has to do with right-sizing your backend resources. To do this, you can leverage load balancer integrations for backend target resources. Using the load balancer integration with Auto Scaling groups, targets will be added or removed from the load balancer as required in response to incoming traffic. Load balancers can also integrate with [Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html) and [Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html) for containerized workloads.

### Implementation steps

-   Define your load balancing requirements including traffic volume, availability and application scalability.
    
-   Choose the right load balancer type for your application.
    
    -   Use Application Load Balancer for HTTP/HTTPS workloads.
        
    -   Use Network Load Balancer for non-HTTP workloads that run on TCP or UDP.
        
    -   Use a combination of both ([ALB as a target of NLB](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/application-load-balancer-type-target-group-for-network-load-balancer/)) if you want to leverage features of both products. For example, you can do this if you want to use the static IPs of NLB together with HTTP header based routing from ALB, or if you want to expose your HTTP workload to an [AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-share-your-services.html).
        
    -   For a full comparison of load balancers, see [ELB product comparison](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/features/).
        
    
-   Use SSL/TLS offloading if possible.
    
    -   Configure HTTPS/TLS listeners with both [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html) and [Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-tls-listener.html) integrated with [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/).
        
    -   Note that some workloads may require end-to-end encryption for compliance reasons. In this case, it is a requirement to allow encryption at the targets.
        
    -   For security best practices, see [SEC09-BP02 Enforce encryption in transit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_protect_data_transit_encrypt.html).
        
    
-   Select the right routing algorithm (only ALB).
    
    -   The routing algorithm can make a difference in how well-used your backend targets are and therefore how they impact performance. For example, ALB provides [two options for routing algorithms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html#modify-routing-algorithm):
        
    -   **Least outstanding requests:** Use to achieve a better load distribution to your backend targets for cases when the requests for your application vary in complexity or your targets vary in processing capability.
        
    -   **Round robin:** Use when the requests and targets are similar, or if you need to distribute requests equally among targets.
        
    
-   Consider cross-zone or zonal isolation.
    
    -   Use cross-zone turned off (zonal isolation) for latency improvements and zonal failure domains. It is turned off by default in NLB and in [ALB you can turn it off per target group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/disable-cross-zone.html).
        
    -   Use cross-zone turned on for increased availability and flexibility. By default, cross-zone is turned on for ALB and in [NLB you can turn it on per target group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-cross-zone.html).
        
    
-   Turn on HTTP keep-alives for your HTTP workloads (only ALB). With this feature, the load balancer can reuse backend connections until the keep-alive timeout expires, improving your HTTP request and response time and also reducing resource utilization on your backend targets. For detail on how to do this for Apache and Nginx, see [What are the optimal settings for using Apache or NGINX as a backend server for ELB?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/apache-backend-elb/)
    
-   Turn on monitoring for your load balancer.
    
    -   Turn on access logs for your [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/enable-access-logging.html) and [Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-access-logs.html).
        
    -   The main fields to consider for ALB are `request_processing_time`, `request_processing_time`, and `response_processing_time`.
        
    -   The main fields to consider for NLB are `connection_time` and `tls_handshake_time`.
        
    -   Be ready to query the logs when you need them. You can use Amazon Athena to query both [ALB logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/application-load-balancer-logs.html) and [NLB logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/networkloadbalancer-classic-logs.html).
        
    -   Create alarms for performance related metrics such as [`TargetResponseTime` for ALB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-cloudwatch-metrics.html).
