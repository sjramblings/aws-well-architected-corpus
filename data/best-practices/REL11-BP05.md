# REL11-BP05 — Use static stability to prevent bimodal behavior

## Statement

Workloads should be statically stable and only operate in a single normal mode. Bimodal behavior is when your workload exhibits different behavior under normal and failure modes.

For example, you might try and recover from an Availability Zone failure by launching new instances in a different Availability Zone. This can result in a bimodal response during a failure mode. You should instead build workloads that are statically stable and operate within only one mode. In this example, those instances should have been provisioned in the second Availability Zone before the failure. This static stability design verifies that the workload only operates in a single mode.

## Desired Outcome

Workloads do not exhibit bimodal behavior during normal and failure modes.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   Assuming resources can always be provisioned regardless of the failure scope.
    
-   Trying to dynamically acquire resources during a failure.
    
-   Not provisioning adequate resources across zones or Regions until a failure occurs.
    
-   Considering static stable designs for compute resources only.

## Benefits

Workloads running with statically stable designs are capable of having predictable outcomes during normal and failure events.

## Implementation Guidance

Bimodal behavior occurs when your workload exhibits different behavior under normal and failure modes (for example, relying on launching new instances if an Availability Zone fails). An example of bimodal behavior is when stable Amazon EC2 designs provision enough instances in each Availability Zone to handle the workload load if one AZ were removed. Elastic Load Balancing or Amazon Route 53 health would check to shift a load away from the impaired instances. After traffic has shifted, use AWS Auto Scaling to asynchronously replace instances from the failed zone and launch them in the healthy zones. Static stability for compute deployment (such as EC2 instances or containers) results in the highest reliability.

_Static stability of EC2 instances across Availability Zones_

This must be weighed against the cost for this model and the business value of maintaining the workload under all resilience cases. It's less expensive to provision less compute capacity and rely on launching new instances in the case of a failure, but for large-scale failures (such as an Availability Zone or Regional impairment), this approach is less effective because it relies on both an operational plane, and sufficient resources being available in the unaffected zones or Regions.

Your solution should also weigh reliability against the costs needs for your workload. Static stability architectures apply to a variety of architectures including compute instances spread across Availability Zones, database read replica designs, Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) cluster designs, and multi-Region failover architectures.

It is also possible to implement a more statically stable design by using more resources in each zone. By adding more zones, you reduce the amount of additional compute you need for static stability.

An example of bimodal behavior would be a network timeout that could cause a system to attempt to refresh the configuration state of the entire system. This would add an unexpected load to another component and might cause it to fail, resulting in other unexpected consequences. This negative feedback loop impacts the availability of your workload. Instead, you can build systems that are statically stable and operate in only one mode. A statically stable design would do constant work and always refresh the configuration state on a fixed cadence. When a call fails, the workload would use the previously cached value and initiate an alarm.

Another example of bimodal behavior is allowing clients to bypass your workload cache when failures occur. This might seem to be a solution that accommodates client needs but it can significantly change the demands on your workload and is likely to result in failures.

Assess critical workloads to determine what workloads require this type of resilience design. For those that are deemed critical, each application component must be reviewed. Example types of services that require static stability evaluations are:

-   **Compute**: Amazon EC2, EKS-EC2, ECS-EC2, EMR-EC2
    
-   **Databases**: Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora
    
-   **Storage**: Amazon S3 (Single Zone), Amazon EFS (mounts), Amazon FSx (mounts)
    
-   **Load balancers:** Under certain designs
    

### Implementation steps

-   Build systems that are statically stable and operate in only one mode. In this case, provision enough instances in each Availability Zone or Region to handle the workload capacity if one Availability Zone or Region were removed. A variety of services can be used for routing to healthy resources, such as:
    
    -   [Cross Region DNS Routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/real-time-communication-on-aws/cross-region-dns-based-load-balancing-and-failover.html)
        
    -   [MRAP Amazon S3 MultiRegion Routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MultiRegionAccessPointRequestRouting.html)
        
    -   [AWS Global Accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/)
        
    -   [Amazon Application Recovery Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/what-is-route53-recovery.html)
        
    
-   Configure [database read replicas](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/) to account for the loss of a single primary instance or a read replica. If traffic is being served by read replicas, the quantity in each Availability Zone and each Region should equate to the overall need in case of the zone or Region failure.
    
-   Configure critical data in Amazon S3 storage that is designed to be statically stable for data stored in case of an Availability Zone failure. If [Amazon S3 One Zone-IA](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/04/announcing-s3-one-zone-infrequent-access-a-new-amazon-s3-storage-class/) storage class is used, this should not be considered statically stable, as the loss of that zone minimizes access to this stored data.
    
-   [Load balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/disable-cross-zone.html) are sometimes configured incorrectly or by design to service a specific Availability Zone. In this case, the statically stable design might be to spread a workload across multiple AZs in a more complex design. The original design may be used to reduce interzone traffic for security, latency, or cost reasons.
