# PERF02-BP05 — Scale your compute resources dynamically

## Statement

Use the elasticity of the cloud to scale your compute resources up or down dynamically to match your needs and avoid over- or under-provisioning capacity for your workload.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You react to alarms by manually increasing capacity.
    
-   You use the same sizing guidelines (generally static infrastructure) as in on-premises.
    
-   You leave increased capacity after a scaling event instead of scaling back down.

## Benefits

Configuring and testing the elasticity of compute resources can help you save money, maintain performance benchmarks, and improve reliability as traffic changes.

## Implementation Guidance

AWS provides the flexibility to scale your resources up or down dynamically through a variety of scaling mechanisms in order to meet changes in demand. Combined with compute-related metrics, a dynamic scaling allows workloads to automatically respond to changes and use the optimal set of compute resources to achieve its goal.

You can use a number of different approaches to match supply of resources with demand.

-   **Target-tracking approach**: Monitor your scaling metric and automatically increase or decrease capacity as you need it.
    
-   **Predictive scaling**: Scale in anticipation of daily and weekly trends.
    
-   **Schedule-based approach**: Set your own scaling schedule according to predictable load changes.
    
-   **Service scaling**: Choose services (like serverless) that that automatically scale by design.
    

You must ensure that workload deployments can handle both scale-up and scale-down events.

### Implementation steps

-   Compute instances, containers, and functions provide mechanisms for elasticity, either in combination with autoscaling or as a feature of the service. Here are some examples of automatic scaling mechanisms:
    
    Autoscaling Mechanism
    
    Where to use
    
    [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html)
    
    To ensure you have the correct number of [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instances available to handle the user load for your application.
    
    [Application Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/what-is-application-auto-scaling.html)
    
    To automatically scale the resources for individual AWS services beyond Amazon EC2 such as [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions or [Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) services.
    
    [Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler/Karpenter](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-karpenter-an-open-source-high-performance-kubernetes-cluster-autoscaler/)
    
    To automatically scale Kubernetes clusters.
    
-   Scaling is often discussed related to compute services like Amazon EC2 Instances or AWS Lambda functions. Be sure to also consider the configuration of non-compute services like [AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/auto-scaling.html) to match the demand.
    
-   Verify that the metrics for scaling match the characteristics of the workload being deployed. If you are deploying a video transcoding application, 100% CPU utilization is expected and should not be your primary metric. Use the depth of the transcoding job queue instead. You can use a [customized metric](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/create-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling-policy-memory-utilization-metric-linux/) for your scaling policy if required. To choose the right metrics, consider the following guidance for Amazon EC2:
    
    -   The metric should be a valid utilization metric and describe how busy an instance is.
        
    -   The metric value must increase or decrease proportionally to the number of instances in the Auto Scaling group.
        
    
-   Make sure that you use [dynamic scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scale-based-on-demand.html) instead of [manual scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-manual-scaling.html) for your Auto Scaling group. We also recommend that you use [target tracking scaling policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-target-tracking.html) in your dynamic scaling.
    
-   Verify that workload deployments can handle both scaling events (up and down). As an example, you can use [Activity history](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-verify-scaling-activity.html) to verify a scaling activity for an Auto Scaling group.
    
-   Evaluate your workload for predictable patterns and proactively scale as you anticipate predicted and planned changes in demand. With predictive scaling, you can eliminate the need to overprovision capacity.
