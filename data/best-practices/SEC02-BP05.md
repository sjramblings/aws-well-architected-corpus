# SEC02-BP05 — Audit and rotate credentials periodically

## Statement

Audit and rotate credentials periodically to limit how long the credentials can be used to access your resources. Long-term credentials create many risks, and these risks can be reduced by rotating long-term credentials regularly.

## Desired Outcome

Implement credential rotation to help reduce the risks associated with long-term credential usage. Regularly audit and remediate non-compliance with credential rotation policies.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   Not auditing credential use.
    
-   Using long-term credentials unnecessarily.
    
-   Using long-term credentials and not rotating them regularly.

## Implementation Guidance

When you cannot rely on temporary credentials and require long-term credentials, audit credentials to verify that defined controls like [multi-factor authentication](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/mfa/) (MFA) are enforced, rotated regularly, and have the appropriate access level.

Periodic validation, preferably through an automated tool, is necessary to verify that the correct controls are enforced. For human identities, you should require users to change their passwords periodically and retire access keys in favor of temporary credentials. As you move from AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to centralized identities, you can [generate a credential report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_getting-report.html) to audit your users.

We also recommend that you enforce and monitor MFA in your identity provider. You can set up [AWS Config Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html), or use [AWS Security Hub CSPM Security Standards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp-controls.html#fsbp-iam-3), to monitor if users have configured MFA. Consider using [IAM Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) to provide temporary credentials for machine identities. In situations when using IAM roles and temporary credentials is not possible, frequent auditing and rotating access keys is necessary.

### Implementation steps

-   **Regularly audit credentials:** Auditing the identities that are configured in your identity provider and IAM helps verify that only authorized identities have access to your workload. Such identities can include, but are not limited to, IAM users, AWS IAM Identity Center users, Active Directory users, or users in a different upstream identity provider. For example, remove people that leave the organization, and remove cross-account roles that are no longer required. Have a process in place to periodically audit permissions to the services accessed by an IAM entity. This helps you identify the policies you need to modify to remove any unused permissions. Use credential reports and [AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html) to audit IAM credentials and permissions. You can use [Amazon CloudWatch to set up alarms for specific API calls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudwatch-alarms-for-cloudtrail.html) called within your AWS environment. [Amazon GuardDuty can also alert you to unexpected activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_finding-types-iam.html), which might indicate overly permissive access or unintended access to IAM credentials.
    
-   **Rotate credentials regularly:** When you are unable to use temporary credentials, rotate long-term IAM access keys regularly (maximum every 90 days). If an access key is unintentionally disclosed without your knowledge, this limits how long the credentials can be used to access your resources. For information about rotating access keys for IAM users, see [Rotating access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_RotateAccessKey).
    
-   **Review IAM permissions:** To improve the security of your AWS account, regularly review and monitor each of your IAM policies. Verify that policies adhere to the principle of least privilege.
    
-   **Consider automating IAM resource creation and updates:** [IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) automates many IAM tasks, such as role and policy management. Alternatively, AWS CloudFormation can be used to automate the deployment of IAM resources, including roles and policies, to reduce the chance of human error because the templates can be verified and version controlled.
    
-   **Use IAM Roles Anywhere to replace IAM users for machine identities:** [IAM Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) allows you to use roles in areas that you traditionally could not, such as on-premise servers. IAM Roles Anywhere uses a trusted [X.509 certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/trust-model.html#signature-verification) to authenticate to AWS and receive temporary credentials. Using IAM Roles Anywhere avoids the need to rotate these credentials, as long-term credentials are no longer stored in your on-premises environment. Please note that you will need to monitor and rotate the X.509 certificate as it approaches expiration.
