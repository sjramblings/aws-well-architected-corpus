# SUS02-BP04 — Optimize geographic placement of workloads based on their networking requirements

## Statement

Select cloud location and services for your workload that reduce the distance network traffic must travel and decrease the total network resources required to support your workload.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You select the workload's Region based on your own location.
    
-   You consolidate all workload resources into one geographic location.
    
-   All traffic flows through your existing data centers.

## Benefits

Placing a workload close to its users provides the lowest latency while decreasing data movement across the network and reducing environmental impact.

## Implementation Guidance

The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around location options such as Regions, Availability Zones, placement groups, and edge locations such as [AWS Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/what-is-outposts.html) and [AWS Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/). These location options are responsible for maintaining connectivity between application components, cloud services, edge networks and on-premises data centers.

Analyze the network access patterns in your workload to identify how to use these cloud location options and reduce the distance network traffic must travel.

## Implementation steps

-   Analyze network access patterns in your workload to identify how users use your application.
    
    -   Use monitoring tools, such as [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) and [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/), to gather data on network activities.
        
    -   Analyze the data to identify the network access pattern.
        
    
-   Select the Regions for your workload deployment based on the following key elements:
    
    -   **Your Sustainability goal:** as explained in [Region selection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/region-selection.html).
        
    -   **Where your data is located:** For data-heavy applications (such as big data and machine learning), application code should run as close to the data as possible.
        
    -   **Where your users are located:** For user-facing applications, choose a Region (or Regions) close to your workload’s users.
        
    -   **Other constraints:** Consider constraints such as cost and compliance as explained in [What to Consider when Selecting a Region for your Workloads](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/what-to-consider-when-selecting-a-region-for-your-workloads/).
        
    
-   Use local caching or [AWS Caching Solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/caching/aws-caching/) for frequently used assets to improve performance, reduce data movement, and lower environmental impact.
    
    Service
    
    When to use
    
    [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
    
    Use to cache static content such as images, scripts, and videos, as well as dynamic content such as API responses or web applications.
    
    [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/)
    
    Use to cache content for web applications.
    
    [DynamoDB Accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/dax/)
    
    Use to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB tables.
    
-   Use services that can help you run code closer to users of your workload:
    
    Service
    
    When to use
    
    [Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/)
    
    Use for compute-heavy operations that are initiated when objects are not in the cache.
    
    [Amazon CloudFront Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-functions.html)
    
    Use for simple use cases like HTTP(s) request or response manipulations that can be initiated by short-lived functions.
    
    [AWS IoT Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/)
    
    Use to run local compute, messaging, and data caching for connected devices.
    
-   Use connection pooling to allow for connection reuse and reduce required resources.
    
-   Use distributed data stores that don’t rely on persistent connections and synchronous updates for consistency to serve regional populations.
    
-   Replace pre-provisioned static network capacity with shared dynamic capacity, and share the sustainability impact of network capacity with other subscribers.
