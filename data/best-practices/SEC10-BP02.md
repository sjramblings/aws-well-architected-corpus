# SEC10-BP02 — Develop incident management plans

## Statement

The first document to develop for incident response is the incident response plan. The incident response plan is designed to be the foundation for your incident response program and strategy.

## Benefits

Developing thorough and clearly defined incident response processes is key to a successful and scalable incident response program. When a security event occurs, clear steps and workflows can help you to respond in a timely manner. You might already have existing incident response processes. Regardless of your current state, it’s important to update, iterate, and test your incident response processes regularly.

## Implementation Guidance

An incident management plan is critical to respond, mitigate, and recover from the potential impact of security incidents. An incident management plan is a structured process for identifying, remediating, and responding in a timely matter to security incidents.

The cloud has many of the same operational roles and requirements found in an on-premises environment. When you create an incident management plan, it is important to factor response and recovery strategies that best align with your business outcome and compliance requirements. For example, if you operate workloads in AWS that are FedRAMP compliant in the United States, follow the recommendations in [NIST SP 800-61 Computer Security Handling Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-61r2.pdf). Similarly, when you operate workloads that store personally identifiable information (PII), consider how to protect and respond to issues related to data residency and use.

When building an incident management plan for your workloads in AWS, start with the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) for building a defense-in-depth approach towards incident response. In this model, AWS manages security of the cloud, and you are responsible for security in the cloud. This means that you retain control and are responsible for the security controls you choose to implement. The [AWS Security Incident Response Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/welcome.html) details key concepts and foundational guidance for building a cloud-centric incident management plan.

An effective incident management plan must be continually iterated upon, remaining current with your cloud operations goal. Consider using the implementation plans detailed below as you create and evolve your incident management plan.

### Implementation steps

1.  Define roles and responsibilities within your organization for handling security events. This should involve representatives from various departments, including:
    
    -   Human resources (HR)
        
    -   Executive team
        
    -   Legal department
        
    -   Application owners and developers (subject matter experts, or SMEs)
        
    
2.  Clearly outline who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (RACI) during an incident. Create a RACI chart to facilitate quick and direct communication, and clearly outline the leadership across different stages of an event.
    
3.  Involve application owners and developers (SMEs) during an incident, as they can provide valuable information and context to aid in measuring the impact. Build relationships with these SMEs, and practice incident response scenarios with them before an actual incident occurs.
    
4.  Involve trusted partners or external experts in the investigation or response process, as they can provide additional expertise and perspective.
    
5.  Align your incident management plans and roles with any local regulations or compliance requirements that govern your organization.
    
6.  Practice and test your incident response plans regularly, and involve all the defined roles and responsibilities. This helps streamline the process and verify you have a coordinated and efficient response to security incidents.
    
7.  Review and update the roles, responsibilities, and RACI chart periodically, or as your organizational structure or requirements change.
    

**Understand AWS response teams and support**

-   **AWS Support**
    
    -   [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/) offers a range of plans that provide access to tools and expertise that support the success and operational health of your AWS solutions. If you need technical support and more resources to help plan, deploy, and optimize your AWS environment, you can select a support plan that best aligns with your AWS use case.
        
    -   Consider the [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support) in AWS Management Console (sign-in required) as the central point of contact to get support for issues that affect your AWS resources. Access to Support is controlled by AWS Identity and Access Management. For more information about getting access to Support features, see [Getting started with Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/getting-started.html#accessing-support).
        
    
-   **AWS Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT)**
    
    -   The AWS Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT) is a specialized 24/7 global AWS team that provides support to customers during active security events on the customer side of the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/).
        
    -   When the AWS CIRT supports you, they provide assistance with triage and recovery for an active security event on AWS. They can assist in root cause analysis through the use of AWS service logs and provide you with recommendations for recovery. They can also provide security recommendations and best practices to help you avoid security events in the future.
        
    -   AWS customers can engage the AWS CIRT through an [Support case](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/case-management.html).
        
    
-   [**AWS Security Incident Response**](https://aws.amazon.com/security-incident-response/)
    
    -   Announced at re:Invent 2024, AWS Security Incident Response is a managed security incident response service that uses both modern triage technology and a human in the loop. The service ingests all GuardDuty findings and any third-party findings sent to AWS Security Hub CSPM for triage to alert the customer only on findings that require an investigation. The service also provides a portal to submit reactive cases in the event of a security event the customer notices and receive support from AWS' advanced incident response team.
        
    
-   **DDoS response support**
    
    -   AWS offers [AWS Shield](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/), which provides a managed distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards web applications running on AWS. Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that can minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage Support to benefit from DDoS protection. There are two tiers of Shield: AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced. To learn about the differences between these two tiers, see [Shield features documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/features/).
        
    
-   **AWS Managed Services (AMS)**
    
    -   [AWS Managed Services (AMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-services/) provides ongoing management of your AWS infrastructure so you can focus on your applications. By implementing best practices to maintain your infrastructure, AMS helps reduce your operational overhead and risk. AMS automates common activities such as change requests, monitoring, patch management, security, and backup services, and provides full-lifecycle services to provision, run, and support your infrastructure.
        
    -   AMS takes responsibility for deploying a suite of security detective controls and provides a 24/7 first line of response to alerts. When an alert is initiated, AMS follows a standard set of automated and manual playbooks to verify a consistent response. These playbooks are shared with AMS customers during onboarding so that they can develop and coordinate a response with AMS.
        
    

**Develop the incident response plan**

The incident response plan is designed to be the foundation for your incident response program and strategy. The incident response plan should be in a formal document. An incident response plan typically includes these sections:

-   **An incident response team overview:** Outlines the goals and functions of the incident response team.
    
-   **Roles and responsibilities:** Lists the incident response stakeholders and details their roles when an incident occurs.
    
-   **A communication plan:** Details contact information and how you communicate during an incident.
    
-   **Backup communication methods:** It’s a best practice to have out-of-band communication as a backup for incident communication. An example of an application that provides a secure out-of-band communications channel is AWS Wickr.
    
-   **Phases of incident response and actions to take:** Enumerates the phases of incident response (for example, detect, analyze, eradicate, contain, and recover), including high-level actions to take within those phases.
    
-   **Incident severity and prioritization definitions:** Details how to classify the severity of an incident, how to prioritize the incident, and then how the severity definitions affect escalation procedures.
    

While these sections are common throughout companies of different sizes and industries, each organization’s incident response plan is unique. You need to build an incident response plan that works best for your organization.
