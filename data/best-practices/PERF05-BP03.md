# PERF05-BP03 — Define a process to improve workload performance

## Statement

Define a process to evaluate new services, design patterns, resource types, and configurations as they become available. For example, run existing performance tests on new instance offerings to determine their potential to improve your workload.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You assume your current architecture is static and won’t be updated over time.
    
-   You introduce architecture changes over time with no metric justification.

## Benefits

By defining your process for making architectural changes, you can use gathered data to influence your workload design over time.

## Implementation Guidance

Your workload's performance has a few key constraints. Document these so that you know what kinds of innovation might improve the performance of your workload. Use this information when learning about new services or technology as it becomes available to identify ways to alleviate constraints or bottlenecks.

Identify the key performance constraints for your workload. Document your workload’s performance constraints so that you know what kinds of innovation might improve the performance of your workload.

### Implementation steps

-   **Identify KPIs:** Identify your workload performance KPIs as outlined in [PERF05-BP01 Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure workload health and performance](./perf_process_culture_establish_key_performance_indicators.html) to baseline your workload.
    
-   **Implement monitoring:** Use [AWS observability tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/management-and-governance-guide/aws-observability-tools.html) to collect performance metrics and measure KPIs.
    
-   **Conduct analysis:** Conduct in-depth analysis to identify the areas (like configuration and application code) in your workload that is under-performing as outlined in [PERF05-BP02 Use monitoring solutions to understand the areas where performance is most critical](./perf_process_culture_use_monitoring_solutions.html). Use your analysis and performance tools to identify the performance improvement strategies.
    
-   **Validate improvements:** Use sandbox or pre-production environments to validate the effectiveness of improvement strategies.
    
-   **Implement changes:** Implement the changes in production and continually monitor the workload’s performance. Document the improvements, and communicate the changes to stakeholders.
    
-   **Revisit and refine:** Regularly review your performance improvement process to identify areas for enhancement.
