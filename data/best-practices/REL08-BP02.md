# REL08-BP02 — Integrate functional testing as part of your deployment

## Statement

Use techniques such as unit tests and integration tests that validate required functionality.

Unit testing is the process where you test the smallest functional unit of code to validate its behavior. Integration testing seeks to validate that each application feature works according to the software requirements. While unit tests focus on testing part of an application in isolation, integration tests consider side effects (for example, the effect of data being changed through a mutation operation). In either case, tests should be integrated into a deployment pipeline, and if success criteria are not met, the pipeline is halted or rolled back. These tests are run in a pre-production environment, which is staged prior to production in the pipeline.

You achieve the best outcomes when these tests are run automatically as part of build and deployment actions. For instance, with AWS CodePipeline, developers commit changes to a source repository where CodePipeline automatically detects the changes. The application is built, and unit tests are run. After the unit tests have passed, the built code is deployed to staging servers for testing. From the staging server, CodePipeline runs more tests, such as integration or load tests. Upon the successful completion of those tests, CodePipeline deploys the tested and approved code to production instances.

## Desired Outcome

You use automation to perform unit and integration tests to validate that your code behaves as expected. These tests are integrated into the deployment process, and a test failure aborts the deployment.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You ignore or bypass test failures and plans during the deployment process in order to accelerate the deployment timeline.
    
-   You manually perform tests outside the deployment pipeline.
    
-   You skip testing steps in the automation through manual emergency workflows.
    
-   You run automated tests in an environment that does not closely resemble the production environment.
    
-   You build a test suite that is insufficiently flexible and is difficult to maintain, update, or scale as the application evolves.

## Benefits

Automated testing during the deployment process catches issues early, which reduces the risk of a release to production with bugs or unexpected behavior. Unit tests validate the code behaves as desired and API contracts are honored. Integration tests validate that the system operates according to specified requirements. These types of tests verify the intended working order of components such as user interfaces, APIs, databases, and source code.

## Implementation Guidance

Adopt a test-driven development (TDD) approach to writing software, where you develop test cases to specify and validate your code. To start, create test cases for each function. If the test fails, you write new code to pass the test. This approach helps you validate the expected result of each function. Run unit tests and validate that they pass before you commit code to a source code repository.

Implement both unit and integration tests as part of the build, test, and deployment stages of the CI/CD pipeline. Automate testing, and automatically initiate tests whenever a new version of the application is ready to be deployed. If success criteria are not met, the pipeline is halted or rolled back.

If the application is a web or mobile app, perform automated integration testing on multiple desktop browsers or real devices. This approach is particularly useful to validate the compatibility and functionality of mobile apps across a diverse range of devices.

### Implementation steps

1.  Write unit tests before you write functional code (_test-driven development_, or TDD). Establish code guidelines so that writing and running unit tests are a non-functional coding requirement.
    
2.  Create a suite of automated integration tests that cover the identified testable functionalities. These tests should simulate user interactions and validate the expected outcomes.
    
3.  Create the necessary test environment to run the integration tests. This may include staging or pre-production environments that closely mimic the production environment.
    
4.  Set up your source, build, test, and deploy stages using the AWS CodePipeline console or AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).
    
5.  Deploy the application once the code has been built and tested. AWS CodeDeploy can deploy it to your staging (testing) and production environments. These environments may include Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda functions, or on-premises servers. The same deployment mechanism should be used to deploy the application to all environments.
    
6.  Monitor the progress of your pipeline and the status of each stage. Use quality checks to block the pipeline based on the status of your tests. You can also receive notifications for any pipeline stage failure or pipeline completion.
    
7.  Continually monitor the results of the tests, and look for patterns, regressions or areas that require more attention. Use this information to improve the test suite, identify areas of the application that need more robust testing, and optimize the deployment process.
