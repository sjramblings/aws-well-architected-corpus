# SUS05-BP03 — Use managed services

## Statement

Use managed services to operate more efficiently in the cloud.

## Common Anti-Patterns

-   You use Amazon EC2 instances with low utilization to run your applications.
    
-   Your in-house team only manages the workload, without time to focus on innovation or simplifications.
    
-   You deploy and maintain technologies for tasks that can run more efficiently on managed services.

## Benefits

-   Using managed services shifts the responsibility to AWS, which has insights across millions of customers that can help drive new innovations and efficiencies.
    
-   Managed service distributes the environmental impact of the service across many users because of the multi-tenet control planes.

## Implementation Guidance

Managed services shift responsibility to AWS for maintaining high utilization and sustainability optimization of the deployed hardware. Managed services also remove the operational and administrative burden of maintaining a service, which allows your team to have more time and focus on innovation.

Review your workload to identify the components that can be replaced by AWS managed services. For example, [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/), and [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) provide a managed database service. [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/), [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/), and [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/) provide a managed analytics service.

**Implementation steps**

1.  **Inventory your workload:** Inventory your workload for services and components.
    
2.  **Identify candidates:** Assess and identify components that can be replaced by managed services. Here are some examples of when you might consider using a managed service:
    
    Task
    
    What to use on AWS
    
    Hosting a database
    
    Use managed [Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) instances instead of maintaining your own Amazon RDS instances on [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
    
    Hosting a container workload
    
    Use [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/), instead of implementing your own container infrastructure.
    
    Hosting web apps
    
    Use [AWS Amplify Hosting](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/hosting/) as fully managed CI/CD and hosting service for static websites and server-side rendered web apps.
    
3.  **Create a migration plan:** Identify dependencies and create a migrations plan. Update runbooks and playbooks accordingly.
    
    -   The [AWS Application Discovery Service](https://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/) automatically collects and presents detailed information about application dependencies and utilization to help you make more informed decisions as you plan your migration
        
    
4.  **Perform tests** Test the service before migrating to the managed service.
    
5.  **Replace self-hosted services:** Use your migration plan to replace self-hosted services with managed service.
    
6.  **Monitor and adjust:** Continually monitor the service after the migration is complete to make adjustments as required and optimize the service.
